exercizeth his Mystery (whether it be in printing, bynding or selling of
Bookes) with more respect to the glory of God &amp; the publike aduantage
than to his owne Commodity &amp; is both an ornament &amp; a profitable
member in a ciuill Commonwealth.... If he be a Printer he makes conscience
to exemplefy his Coppy fayrely &amp; truly. If he be a Booke-bynder, he is
no meere Bookeseller (that is) one who selleth meerely ynck &amp; paper
bundled up together for his owne aduantage only: but he is a Chapman of
Arts, of wisdome, &amp; of much experience for a little money.... The
reputation of Schollers is as deare unto him as his owne: For, he
acknowledgeth that from them his Mystery had both begining and means of
continuance. He heartely loues &amp; seekes the Prosperity of his owne
Corporation: Yet he would not iniure the Uniuersityes to advantage it. In a
word, he is such a man that the State ought to cherish him; Schollers to
loue him; good Customers to frequent his shopp; and the whole Company of
Stationers to pray for him.&quot;</i><br> <br> --GEORGE WITHER,

<p><i>Frontispiece</i></p>

<p>This fine presentation of the dress of a gentlewoman and infant child,
in the middle of the seventeenth century, hung in old Plymouth homes in the
Thomas and Stevenson families till it came by inheritance to the present
owner, Mrs. Greely Stevenson Curtis of Boston, Mass. The artist is unknown.
</p>

<p><a href="#Governor_John_Endicott">JOHN ENDICOTT</a></p>

<p>Born in Dorchester, Eng., 1589. Died in Boston, Mass., 1665. He
emigrated to America in 1628; became governor of the colony in 1644, and
was major-general of the colonial troops. He hated Indians, the Church of
Rome, and Quakers. He wears a velvet skull-cap, and a finger-ring, which is
somewhat unusual; a square band; a richly fringed and embroidered glove;
and a &quot;stiletto&quot; beard. This portrait is in the Essex Institute,
Salem, Mass.</p>

<p><a href="#Governor_Edward_Winslow.">EDWARD WINSLOW</a></p>

<p>Born in England, 1595; died at sea, 1655. One of the founders of the
Plymouth colony in 1620; and governor of that colony in 1633, 1636, 1644.
This portrait is dated 1651. It is in Pilgrim Hall, Plymouth, Mass.</p>

<p><a href="#Governor_John_Winthrop.">JOHN WINTHROP</a></p>

<p>Born in England, 1588; died in Boston, 1649. Educated at Trinity
College, Cambridge; admitted to the Inner Temple, 1628. Made governor of
Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629. Arrived in Salem, 1630. His portrait by
Van Dyck and a fine miniature exist. The latter is owned by American
Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Mass. This picture is copied from a very
rare engraving from the miniature, which is finer and even more thoughtful
in expression than the portrait. Both have the lace-edged ruff, but the
shape of the dress is indistinct.</p>

<p><a href="#Governor_Simon_Bradstreet.">SIMON BRADSTREET</a></p>

<p>Born in England, 1603; died in Salem, Mass., 1697. He was governor of
the colony when he was ninety years old. The Labadists, who visited him,
wrote: &quot;He is an old man, quiet and grave; dressed in black silk, but
not sumptuously.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="#Sir_Richard_Saltonstall.">SIR RICHARD SALTONSTALL</a></p>

<p>A mayor of London who came to Salem among the first settlers. The New
England families of his name are all descended from him. He wears buff-coat
and trooping scarf. This portrait was painted by Rembrandt.</p>

poet, historian, nobleman, soldier, explorer, and colonizer. He was the
favorite of Elizabeth; the colonizer of Virginia; the hero of the Armada;
the victim of King James. In this portrait he wears a slashed jerkin; a
lace ruff; a broad trooping scarf with great lace shoulder-knot; a jewelled
sword-belt; full, embroidered breeches; lace-edged garters, and vast
shoe-roses, which combine to form a confused dress.</p>

<p><a href="#Sir_Walter_Raleigh_and_Son.">SIR WALTER RALEIGH AND
SON</a></p>

<p>This print was owned by the author for many years, with the written
endorsement by some unknown hand, <i>Martin Frobisher and Son</i>. I am
glad to learn that it is from a painting by Zucchero of Raleigh and his
son, and is owned at Wickham Court, in Kent, Eng., by the descendant of one
of Raleigh's companions in his explorations. The child's dress is less
fantastic than other portraits of English children of the same date.</p>

<h3>APPAREL OF THE PURITAN AND PILGRIM FATHERS</h3>

<p style='text-indent: 0em'> <img src="images\initiali.png" align=left
alt="I"> t is difficult to discover the reasons, to trace the influences
which have resulted in the production in the modern mind of that composite
figure which serves to the everyday reader, the heedless observer, as the
counterfeit presentment of the New England colonist,--the Boston Puritan or
Plymouth Pilgrim. We have a very respectable notion, a fairly true picture,
of Dutch patroon, Pennsylvania Quaker, and Virginia planter; but we see a
very unreal New Englishman. This &quot;gray old Gospeller, sour as
midwinter,&quot; appears with goodwife or dame in the hastily drawn
illustrations of our daily press; we find him outlined with greater care
but equal inaccuracy in our choicer periodical literature; we have him
depicted by artists in our handsome books and on the walls of our art
museums; he is cut in stone and cast in bronze for our halls and parks; he
is dressed by actors for a part in some historical play; he is furbished up
with conglomerate and makeshift garments by enthusiastic and confident
young folk in tableau and fancy-dress party; he is richly and amply attired
by portly, self-satisfied members of our patriotic-hereditary societies; we
constantly see these figures garbed in semblance in some details, yet never
in verisimilitude as a whole figure.</p>

<p>We are wont to think of our Puritan forbears, indeed we are determined
to think of them, garbed in sombre sad-colored garments, in a life devoid
of color, warmth, or fragrance. But sad color was not dismal and dull save
in name; it was brown in tone, and brown is warm, and being a primitive
color is, like many primitive things, cheerful. Old England was garbed in
hearty honest russet, even in the days of our colonization. Read the list
of the garments of any master of the manor, of the honest English yeoman,
of our own sturdy English emigrants from manor and farm in Suffolk and
Essex. What did they wear across seas? What did they wear in the New World?
What they wore in England, namely: Doublets of leathers, all brown in tint;
breeches of various tanned skins and hides; untanned leather shoes; jerkins
of &quot;filomot&quot; or &quot;phillymort&quot; (feuille morte), dead-leaf
color; buff-coats of fine buff leather; tawny camlet cloaks and jackets of
&quot;du Boys&quot; (which was wood color); russet hose; horseman's coats
of tan-colored linsey-woolsey or homespun ginger-lyne or brown perpetuana;
fawn-colored mandillions and deer-colored cassocks--all brown; and
sometimes a hat of natural beaver. Here is a &quot;falding&quot; doublet of
&quot;treen color&quot;--and what is treen but wooden and wood color is
brown again.</p>

<p>It was a fitting dress for their conditions of life. The colonists lived
close to nature--they touched the beginnings of things; and we are close to
nature when all dress in russet. The homely &quot;butternuts&quot; of the
Kentucky mountains express this; so too does khaki, a good, simple native
dye and stuff; so eagerly welcomed, so closely cherished, as all good and
primitive things should be.</p>

<p>So when I think of my sturdy Puritan forbears in the summer planting of
Salem and of Boston, I see them in &quot;honest russet kersey&quot;; gay
too with the bright stamell-red of their waistcoats and the grain-red
linings of mandillions; scarlet-capped are they, and enlivened with many a
great scarlet-hooded cloak. I see them in this attire on shipboard, where
they were greeted off Salem with &quot;a smell from the shore like the
smell of a garden&quot;; I see them landing in happy June amid &quot;sweet
wild strawberries and fair single roses.&quot; I see them walking along the
little lanes and half-streets in which for many years bayberry and
sweet-fern lingered in dusty fragrant clumps by the roadside.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Scented with Caedar and Sweet Fern<br>
From Heats reflection dry,&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>wrote of that welcoming shore one colonist who came on the first ship,
and noted in rhyme what he found and saw and felt and smelt. And I see the
forefathers standing under the hot little cedar trees of the Massachusetts
coast, not sober in sad color, but cheery in russet and scarlet; and
sweetbrier and strawberries, bayberry and cedar, smell sweetly and glow
genially in that summer sunlight which shines down on us through all these
two centuries.</p>

<p>We have ample sources from which to learn precisely what was worn by
these first colonists--men and women--gentle and simple. We have minute
&quot;Lists of Apparell&quot; furnished by the Colonization Companies to
the male colonists; we have also ample lists of apparel supplied to
individual emigrants of varied degree; we have inventories in detail of the
personal estates of all those who died in the colonies even in the earliest
years--inventories wherein even a half-worn pair of gloves is gravely set
down, appraised in value, sworn to, and entered in the town records; we
have wills giving equal minuteness; we have even the articles of dress
themselves preserved from moth and rust and mildew; we have private letters
asking that supplies of clothing be sent across seas--clothing substantial
and clothing fashionable; we have ships' bills of lading showing that these
orders were carried out; we have curiously minute private letters giving
quaint descriptions and hints of new and modish wearing apparel; we have
sumptuary laws telling what articles of clothing must not be worn by those
of mean estate; we have court records showing trials under these laws; we
have ministers' sermons denouncing excessive details of fashion,
enumerating and almost describing the offences; and we have also a goodly
number of portraits of men and a few of women. I give in this chapter
excellent portraits of the first governors, Endicott, Winthrop, Bradstreet,
Winslow; and others could be added. Having all these, do we need
fashion-plates or magazines of the modes? We have also for the early years
great instruction through comparison and inference in knowing the English
fashions of those dates as revealed through inventories, compotuses,
accounts, diaries, letters, portraits, prints, carvings, and effigies; and
American fashions varied little from English ones.</p>

<p>It is impossible to disassociate the history of costume from the general
history of the country where such dress is worn. Nor could any one write
upon dress with discrimination and balance unless he knew thoroughly the
dress of all countries and likewise the history of all countries. Of the
special country, he must know more than general history, for the relations
of small things to great things are too close. Influences apparently remote
prove vital. At no time was history told in dress, and at no period was
dress influenced by historical events more than during the seventeenth
century and in the dress of English-speaking folk. The writer on dress
should know the temperament and character of the dress wearer; this was of
special bearing in the seventeenth century. It would be thought by any one
ignorant of the character of the first Puritan settlers, and indifferent to
or ignorant of historical facts, that in a new world with all the
hardships, restraints, lacks, and inconveniences, no one, even the vainest
woman, would think much upon dress, save that it should be warm,
comfortable, ample, and durable. But, in truth, such was not the case. Even
in the first years the settlers paid close attention to their attire, to
its richness, its elegance, its modishness, and watched narrowly also the
attire of their neighbors, not only from a distinct liking for dress, but
from a careful regard of social distinctions and from a regard for the
proprieties and relations of life. Dress was a badge of rank, of social
standing and dignity; and class distinctions were just as zealously guarded
in America, the land of liberty, as in England. The Puritan church preached
simplicity of dress; but the church attendants never followed that
preaching. All believed, too, that dress had a moral effect, as it
certainly does; that to dress orderly and well and convenable to the
existing fashions helped to preserve the morals of the individual and
general welfare of the community. Eagerly did the settlers seek every year,
every season, by every incoming ship, by every traveller, to learn the
changes of fashions in Europe. The first native-born poet, Benjamin
Tompson, is quoted in the heading of this chapter in a wail over thus
following new fashions, a wail for the &quot;good old times,&quot; as has
been the cry of &quot;old fogy&quot; poets and philosophers since the days
of the ancient classics.</p>

<p>We have ample proof of the love of dignity, of form, of state, which
dominated even in the first struggling days; we can see the governor of
Virginia when he landed, turning out his entire force in most formal attire
and with full company of forty halberdiers in scarlet cloaks to attend in
imposing procession the church services in the poor little church
edifice--this when the settlement at Jamestown was scarce more than an
encampment.</p>

<p>We can read the words of Winthrop, the governor of Massachusetts, in
which he recounts his mortification at the undignified condition of affairs
when the governor of the French province, the courtly La Tour, landed
unexpectedly in Boston and caught the governor picnicking peacefully with
his family on an island in the harbor, with no attendants, no soldiers, no
dignitaries. Nor was there any force in the fort, and therefore no salute
could be given to the distinguished visitors; and still more mortifying was
the sole announcement of this important arrival through the hurried sail
across the bay, and the running to the governor of a badly scared woman
neighbor. We see Winthrop trying to recover his dignity in La Tour's eyes
(and in his own) by bourgeoning throughout the remainder of the French
governor's stay with an imposing guard of soldiers in formal attendance at
every step he took abroad; ordering them to wear, I am sure, their very
fullest stuffed doublets and shiniest armor, while he displayed his best
black velvet suit of garments. Fortunately for New England's appearance,
Winthrop was a man of such aristocratic bearing and feature that no dress
or lack of dress could lower his dignity.</p>

<p>Our forbears did not change their dress by emigrating; they may have
worn heavier clothing in New England, more furs, stronger shoes, but I
cannot find that they adopted simpler or less costly clothing; any change
that may have been made through Puritan belief and teaching had been made
in England. All the colonists</p>

<blockquote>&quot; ... studied after nyce array,<br>
And made greet cost in clothing.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Many persons preferred to keep their property in the form of what they
quaintly called &quot;duds.&quot; The fashion did not wear out more apparel
than the man; for clothing, no matter what its cut, was worn as long as it
lasted, doing service frequently through three generations. For instance,
we find Mrs. Epes, of Ipswich, Massachusetts, when she was over fifty years
old, receiving this bequest by will: &quot;If she desire to have the suit
of damask which was the Lady Cheynies her grandmother, let her have it upon
appraisement.&quot; I have traced a certain flowered satin gown and
&quot;manto&quot; in four wills; a dame to her daughter; she to her sister;
then to the child of the last-named who was a granddaughter of the first
owner. And it was a proud possession to the last. The fashions and shapes
then did not change yearly. The Boston gentlewoman of 1660 would not have
been ill dressed or out of the mode in the dress worn by her grandmother
when she landed in 1625.</p>

<p>Petty details were altered in woman's dress--though but slightly; the
change of a cap, a band, a scarf, a ruffle, meant much to the wearer,
though it seems unimportant to us to-day. Men's dress, we know from
portraits, was unaltered for a time save in neckwear and hair-dressing,
both being of such importance in costume that they must be written upon at
length.</p>

<p>Let us fix in our minds the limit of reign of each ruler during the
early years of colonization, and the dates of settlement of each colony.
When Elizabeth died in 1603, the Brownist Puritans or Separatists were well
established in Holland; they had been there twenty years. They were
dissatisfied with their Dutch home, however, and had had internal
quarrels--one, of petty cause, namely, a &quot;topish Hatt,&quot; a
&quot;Schowish Hood,&quot; a &quot;garish spitz-fashioned Stomacher,&quot;
the vain garments of one woman; but the strife over these
&quot;abhominations&quot; lasted eleven years.</p>

<p>James I was king when the Pilgrims came to America in 1620; but Charles
I was on the throne in 1630 when John Winthrop arrived with his band of
friends and followers and settled in Salem and Boston.</p>

<p>The settlement of Portsmouth and Dover in New Hampshire was in 1623, and
in Maine the same year. The settlements of the Dutch in New Netherland were
in 1614; while Virginia, named for Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen, and
discovered in her day, was settled first of all at Jamestown in 1607. The
Plymouth colony was poor. It came poor from Holland, and grew poorer
through various misfortunes and set-backs--one being the condition of the
land near Plymouth. The Massachusetts Bay Company was different. It came
with properties estimated to be worth a million dollars, and it had
prospered wonderfully after an opening year of want and distress. The
relative social condition and means of the settlers of Jamestown, of
Plymouth, of Boston, were carefully investigated from English sources by a
thoughtful and fair authority, the historian Green. He says of the Boston
settlers in his <i>Short History of the English People</i>:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Those Massachusetts settlers were not like the earlier
colonists of the South; broken men, adventurers, bankrupts, criminals; or
simply poor men and artisans like the Pilgrim Fathers of the
<i>Mayflower</i>. They were in great part men of the professional and
middle classes, some of them men of large landed estate, some zealous
clergymen, some shrewd London lawyers or young scholars from Oxford. The
bulk were God-fearing farmers from Lincolnshire and the Eastern
counties.&quot;<br> </blockquote>

<p>A full comprehension of these differences in the colonies will make us
understand certain conditions, certain surprises, as to dress; for
instance, why so little of the extreme Puritan is found in the dress of the
first Boston colonists.</p>

<p>There lived in England, near the close of Elizabeth's reign, a Puritan
named Philip Stubbes, to whom we are infinitely indebted for our knowledge
of English dress of his times. It was also the dress of the colonists; for
details of attire, especially of men's wear, had not changed to any extent
since the years in which and of which Philip Stubbes wrote.</p>

<p>He published in 1586 a book called <i>An Anatomie of Abuses</i>, in
which he described in full the excesses of England in his day. He wrote
with spirited, vivid pen, and in plain speech, leaving nothing unspoken
lest it offend, and he used strong, racy English words and sentences. In
his later editions he even took pains to change certain &quot;strange,
inkhorn terms&quot; or complicate words of his first writing into simpler
ones. Thus he changed <i>preter time</i> to <i>former ages; auditory</i> to
<i>hearers; prostrated</i> to <i>humbled; consummate</i> to <i>ended</i>;
and of course this was to the book's advantage. Unusual words still linger,
however, but we must believe they are not intentionally
&quot;outlandish&quot; as was the term of the day for such words.</p>

<p>The attitude of Stubbes toward dress and dress wearers is of great
interest, for he was certainly one of the most severe, most determined,
most conscientious of Puritans; yet his hatred of &quot;corruptions
desiring reformation&quot; did not lead him to a hatred of dress in itself.
He is careful to state in detail in the body of his book and in his preface
that his attack is not upon the dress of people of wealth and station; that
he approves of rich dress for the rich. His hatred is for the pretentious
dress of the many men of low birth or of mean estate who lavish their all
in dress ill suited to their station; and also his reproof is for swindling
in dress materials and dress-making; against false weights and measures,
adulterations and profits; in short, against abuses, not uses.</p>

<br><br>

<p>His words run thus explicitly:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Whereas I have spoken of the excesse in apparell, and of
the Abuse of the same as wel in Men as in Women, generally I would not be
so understood as though my speaches extended to any either noble honorable
or worshipful; for I am farre from once thinking that any kind of
sumptuous or gorgeous Attire is not to be worn of them; as I suppose them
rather Ornaments in them than otherwise. And therefore when I speak of
excesse of Apparel my meaning is of the inferiour sorte only who for the
most parte do farre surpasse either noble honorable or worshipful,
ruffling in Silks Velvets, Satens, Damaske, Taffeties, Gold Silver and
what not; these bee the Abuses I speak of, these bee the Evills that I
lament, and these bee the Persons my wordes doe concern.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>There was ample room for reformation from Stubbes's point of view.</p>

<blockquote> &quot;There is such a confuse mingle mangle of apparell and
such preponderous excess thereof, as every one is permitted to flaunt it
out in what apparell he has himself or can get by anie kind of means. So
that it is verie hard to know who is noble, who is worshipful, who is a
gentleman, who is not; for you shall have those who are neither of the
nobilytie, gentilitie, nor yeomanrie goe daylie in silks velvets satens
damasks taffeties notwithstanding they be base by byrth, meane by estate
and servyle by calling. This a great confusion, a general disorder. God
bee mercyfull unto us.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>This regard of dress was, I take it, the regard of the Puritan reformer
in general; it was only excess in dress that was hated. This was certainly
the estimate of the best of the Puritans, and it was certainly the belief
of the New England Puritan. It would be thought, and was thought by some
men, that in the New World liberty of religious belief and liberty of dress
would be given to all. Not at all!--the Puritan magistrates at once set to
work to show, by means of sumptuary laws, rules of town settlement, and
laws as to Sunday observance and religious services, that nothing of the
kind was expected or intended, or would be permitted willingly. No
religious sects and denominations were welcome save the Puritans and allied
forms--Brownists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists. For a time none other
were permitted to hold services; no one could wear rich dress save
gentlefolk, and folk of wealth or some distinction--as Stubbes said,
&quot;by being in some sort of office&quot;</p>

<p>We shall find in the early pages of this book frequent references to
Stubbes's descriptions of articles of dress, but his own life has some
bearing on his utterances; so let me bear testimony as to his character and
to the absolute truth of his descriptions. He was held up in his own day to
contempt by that miserable Thomas Nashe who plagiarized his title and
helped his own dull book into popularity by calling it <i>The Anatomie of
Absurdities</i>; and who further ran on against him in a still duller book,
<i>An Almand for a Parrat</i>. He called Stubbes &quot;A MarPrelate Zealot
and Hypocrite&quot; and Stubbes has been held up by others as a morose man
having no family ties and no social instincts. He was in reality the
tenderest of husbands to a modest, gentle, pious girl whom he married when
she was but fourteen, and with whom he lived in ideal happiness until her
death in child-birth when eighteen years old. He bore testimony to his
happiness and her goodness in a loving but sad and trying book
&quot;intituled&quot; <i>A Christiall Glasse for Christian Women</i>. It is
a record of a life which was indeed pure as crystal; a life so retiring, so
quiet, so composed, so unvarying, a life so remote from any gentlewoman's
life to day that it seems of another ether, another planet, as well as of
another century. But it is useful for us to know it, notwithstanding its
background of gloomy religionism and its air of unreality; for it helps us
to understand the character of Puritan women and of Philip Stubbes. This
fair young wife died in an ecstasy, her voice triumphant, her face radiant
with visions of another and a glorious life. And yet she was not wholly
happy in death; for she had a Puritan conscience, and she thought she
<i>must</i> have offended God in some way. She had to search far indeed for
the offence; and this was it--it would be absurd if it were not so true and
so deep in its sentiment of regret. She and her husband had set their
hearts too much in affection upon a little dog that they had loved well,
and she found now that &quot;it was a vanitye&quot;; and she repented of
it, and bade them bear the dog from her bedside. Knowing Stubbes's love for
this little dog (and knowing it must have been a spaniel, for they were
then being well known and beloved and were called &quot;Spaniel-gentles or
comforters&quot;--a wonderfully appropriate name), I do not much mind the
fierce words with which he stigmatizes the vanity and extravagance of
women. I have a strong belief too that if we knew the dress of his
child-wife, we would find that he liked her bravely even richly attired,
and that he acquired his wonderful mastery of every term and detail of
women's dress, every term of description, through a very uxorious regard of
his wife's apparel.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Of the absolute truth of every word in Stubbes's accounts we have ample
corroborative proof. He wrote in real earnest, in true zeal, for the reform
of the foolery and extravagance he saw around him, not against imaginary
evils. There is ample proof in the writings of his contemporaries--in
Shakespere's comparisons, in Harrison's sensible <i>Description of
England</i>, in Tom Coryat's <i>Crudities</i>--and oddities--of the
existence of this foolishness and extravagance. There is likewise ample
proof in the sumptuary laws of Elizabeth's day.</p>

<p>It would have been the last thing the solemn Stubbes could have liked or
have imagined, that he should have afforded important help to future
writers upon costume, yet such is the case. For he described the dress of
English men and women with as much precision as a modern reporter of the
modes. No casual survey of dress could have furnished to him the detail of
his description. It required much examination and inquiry, especially as to
the minutiae of women's dress. Therefore when I read his bitter pages (if I
can forget the little pet spaniel) I have always a comic picture in my mind
of a sour, morose, shocked old Puritan, &quot;a meer, bitter, narrow-sould
Puritan&quot; clad in cloak and doublet, with great horn spectacles on
nose, and ample note-book, penner, and ink-horn in hand, agonizingly though
eagerly surveying the figure of one of his fashion-clad women neighbors,
walking around her slowly, asking as he walked the name of this jupe, the
price of that pinner, the stuff of this sleeve, the cut of this cap,
groaning as he wrote it all down, yet never turning to squire or knight
till every detail of her extravagance and &quot;greet cost&quot; is
recorded. In spite of all his moralizing his quill pen had too sharp a
point, his scowling forehead and fierce eyes too keen a power of vision
ever to render to us a dull page; even the author of <i>Wimples and
Crisping Pins</i> might envy his powers of perception and description.</p>

<p>The bravery of the Jacobean gallant did not differ in the main from his
dress under Elizabeth; but in details he found some extravagances. The
love-locks became more prominent, and shoe-roses and garters both grew in
size. Pomanders were carried by men and women, and
&quot;casting-bottles.&quot; Gloves and pockets were perfumed. As musk was
the favorite scent this perfume-wearing is not over-alluring. As a
preventive of the plague all perfumes were valued.</p>

<p>Since a hatred and revolt against this excess was one of the conditions
which positively led to the formation of the Puritan political party if not
of the Separatist religious faith, and as a consequence to the settlement
of the English colonies in America, let us recount the conditions of dress
in England when America was settled. Let us regard first the dress of a
courtier whose name is connected closely and warmly in history and romance
with the colonization of America; a man who was hated by the Pilgrim and
Puritan fathers but whose dress in some degree and likeness, though
modified and simplified, must have been worn by the first emigrants to
Virginia across seas--let us look at the portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh. He
was a hero and a scholar, but he was also a courtier; and of a court, too,
where every court-attendant had to bethink himself much and ever of dress,
for dress occupied vastly the thought and almost wholly the public
conversation of his queen and her successor.</p>

<br><br>

<p>To understand Raleigh's dress, you must know the man and his life; to
comprehend its absurdities and forgive its follies and see whence it
originated, you must know Elizabeth and her dress; you must see her with
&quot;oblong face, eyes small, yet black; her nose a little hooked, her
lips narrow, her teeth black; false hair and that red,&quot;--these are the
striking and plain words of the German ambassador to her court. You must
look at this queen with her colorless meagre person lost in a dress
monstrous in size, yet hung, even in its enormous expanse of many square
yards, with crowded ornaments, tags, jewels, laces, embroideries, gimp,
feathers, knobs, knots, and aglets, with these bedizened rankly,
embellished richly. You must see her talking in public of buskins and
gowns, love-locks and virginals, anything but matters of seriousness or of
state; you must note her at a formal ceremonial tickling handsome Dudley in
the neck; watch her dancing, &quot;most high and disposedly&quot; when in
great age; you must see her giving Essex a hearty boxing of the ear; hear
her swearing at her ministers. You must remember, too, her parents, her
heritage. From King Henry VIII came her love of popularity, her great
activity, her extraordinary self-confidence, her indomitable will, her
outbursts of anger, her cruelty, just as came her harsh, mannish voice.
From her mother, Anne Boleyn, came her sensuous love of pleasure, of dress,
of flattery, of gayety and laughter. Her nature came from her mother, her
temper from her father. The familiarity with Robert Dudley was but a piece
with her boisterous romps in her girlhood, and her flap in the face of
young Talbot when he saw her &quot;unready in my night-stuff.&quot; But she
had more in her than came from Henry and Anne; she had her own
individuality, which made her as hard as steel, made her resolute, made her
live frugally and work hard, and, above all, made her know her limitations.
The woman, be she queen or the plainest mortal, who can estimate accurately
her own limitations, who is proof against enthusiasm, proof against
ambition, and, at a climax, proof against flattery, who knows what she can
<i>not</i> do, in that very thing finds success. Elizabeth was and ever
will be a wonderful character-study; I never weary of reading or thinking
of her.</p>

<p>The settlement of Massachusetts was under James I; but costume varied
little, save that it became more cumbersome. This may be attributed
directly to the cowardice of the king, who wore quilted and
padded--dagger-proof--clothing; and thus gave to his courtiers an example
of stuffing and padding which exceeded even that of the men of Elizabeth's
day. &quot;A great, round, abominable breech,&quot; did the satirists call
it. Stays had to be worn beneath the long-waisted, peascod-bellied, stuffed
doublet to keep it in shape; thus a man's attire had scarcely a single
natural outline.</p>

<p>We have this description of Raleigh, courtier and &quot;servant&quot; of
Elizabeth and victim of James, given by a contemporary, Aubrey:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;He looked like a Knave with his gogling eyes. He could
transform himself into any shape. He was a tall, handsome, bold man; but
his naeve was that he was damnably proud. A good piece of him is in a white
satin doublet all embroidered with rich pearls, and a mighty told me that
the true pearls were nigh as big as the painted ones. He had a most
remarkable aspect, an exceeding high forehead, long faced, and sour
eie-lidded, a kind of pigge-eie.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>We leave the choice of belief between one sentence of this personal
description, that he was handsome, and the later plain-spoken details to
the judgment of the reader. Certainly both statements cannot be true. As I
look at his portrait, the &quot;good piece of him&quot; <a
href="#Sir_Walter_Raleigh.">here</a>, I wholly disbelieve the former.</p>

<br><br>

<p>His laced-in, stiffened waist, his absurd breeches, his ruffs and sashes
and knots, his great shoe-roses, his jewelled hatband, make this a
fantastic picture, one of little dignity, though of vast cost. The jewels
on his shoes were said to have cost thirty thousand pounds; and the perfect
pearls in his ear, as seen in another portrait, must have been an inch and
a half long. He had doublets entirely covered with a pattern of jewels. In
another portrait (<a href="#Sir_Walter_Raleigh_and_Son.">here</a>) his
little son, poor child, stands by his side in similar stiff attire. The
famous portrait of Sir Philip Sidney and his brother is equally comic in
its absurdity of costume for young lads.</p>

<p>Read these words descriptive of another courtier, of the reign of James;
his favorite, the Duke of Buckingham:--</p>

<blockquote> &quot;With great buttons of diamonds, and with diamond hat
bands, cockades and ear-rings, yoked with great and manifold knots of
pearls. At his going over to Paris in 1625 he had twenty-seven suits of
clothes made the richest that embroidery, gems, lace, silk, velvet, gold
and stones could contribute; one of which was a white uncut velvet set all
over suit and cloak with diamonds valued at &pound;14,000 besides a great
feather stuck all over with diamonds, as were also his sword, girdle,
hat-band and spurs.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>These were all courtiers, but we should in general think of an English
merchant as dressed richly but plainly; yet here is the dress of Marmaduke
Rawdon, a merchant of that day:--</p>

<blockquote> &quot;The apparell he rid in, with his chaine of gold and hat
band was vallued in a thousand Spanish ducats; being two hundred and
seventy and five pounds sterling. His hatband was of esmeralds set in
gold; his suite was of a fine cloth trim'd with a small silke and gold
fringe; the buttons of his suite fine gold--goldsmith's work; his rapier
and dagger richly hatcht with gold.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>The white velvet dress of Buckingham showed one of the extreme fashions
of the day, the wearing of pure white. Horace Walpole had a full-length
painting of Lord Falkland all in white save his black gloves. Another of
Sir Godfrey Hart, 1600, is all in white save scarlet heels to the shoes.
These scarlet heels were worn long in every court. Who will ever forget
their clatter in the pages of Saint Simon, as they ran in frantic haste
through hall and corridor--in terror, in cupidity, in satisfaction, in zeal
to curry favor, in desire to herald the news, in hope to obtain office, in
every mean and detestable spirit--ran from the bedside of the dying king?
We can still hear, after two centuries, the noisy, heartless tapping of
those hurrying red heels.</p>

<p>Look at the portrait of another courtier, Sir Robert Dudley, who died in
1639; not the Robert Dudley who was tickled in the neck by Queen Elizabeth
while he was being dubbed earl; not the Dudley who murdered Amy Robsart,
but his disowned son by a noble lady whom he secretly married and
dishonored. This son was a brave sailor and a learned man. He wrote the
<i>Arcana del Mare</i>, and he was a sportsman; &quot;the first of all that
taught a dog to sit in order to catch partridges.&quot; His portrait shows
clumsy armor and showy rings, a great jewel and a vast tie of gauze ribbon
on one arm; on the other a cord with many aglets; he wears marvellously
embroidered, slashed, and bombasted breeches, tight hose, a heavily
jewelled, broad belt; and a richly fringed scarf over one shoulder, and
ridiculous garters at his calf. It is so absurd, so vain a dress one cannot
wonder that sensible gentlemen turned away in disgust to so-called Puritan
plainness, even if it went to the extreme of Puritan ugliness.</p>

<p>But in truth the eccentrics and extremes of Puritan dress were adopted
by zealots; the best of that dress only was worn by the best men of the
party. All Puritans were not like Philip Stubbes, the moralist; nor did all
Royalists dress like Buckingham, the courtier.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the influence of the word &quot;sad-color.&quot; I
believe that our notion of the gloom of Puritan dress, of the dress
certainly of the New England colonist, comes to us through it, for the term
was certainly much used. A Puritan lover in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in
1645, wrote to his lass that he had chosen for her a sad-colored gown.
Winthrop wrote, &quot;Bring the coarsest woolen cloth, so it be not flocks,
and of sad colours and some red;&quot; and he ordered a &quot;grave
gown&quot; for his wife, &quot;not black, but sad-colour.&quot; But while
sad-colored meant a quiet tint, it did not mean either a dull stone color
or a dingy grayish brown--nor even a dark brown. We read distinctly in an
English list of dyes of the year 1638 of these tints in these words,
&quot;Sadd-colours the following; liver colour, De Boys, tawney, russet,
purple, French green, ginger-lyne, deere colour, orange colour.&quot; Of
these nine tints, five, namely, &quot;De Boys,&quot; tawny, russet,
ginger-lyne, and deer color, were all browns. Other colors in this list of
dyes were called &quot;light colours&quot; and &quot;graine colours.&quot;
Light colors were named plainly as those which are now termed by shopmen
&quot;evening shades&quot;; that is, pale blue, pink, lemon, sulphur,
lavender, pale green, ecru, and cream color. Grain colors were shades of
scarlet, and were worn as much as russet. When dress in sad colors ranged
from purple and French green through the various tints of brown to orange,
it was certainly not a <i>dull</i>-colored dress.</p>

<p>Let us see precisely what were the colors of the apparel of the first
colonists. Let us read the details of russet and scarlet. We find them in
<i>The Record of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New
England</i>, one of the incontrovertible sources which are a delight to
every true historian. These records are in the handwriting of the first
secretary, Washburn, and contain lists of the articles sent on the ships
<i>Talbot, George, Lion's Whelp, Four Sisters</i>, and <i>Mayflower</i> for
the use of the plantation at Naumkeag (Salem) and later at Boston. They
give the amount of iron, coal, and bricks sent as ballast; the red lead,
sail-cloth, and copper; and in 1629, at some month and day previous to 16th
of March, give the order for the &quot;Apparell for 100 men.&quot; We learn
that each colonist had this attire:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;4 Pair Shoes.<br>
2 Pair Irish Stockings about 13d. a pair.<br>
1 Pair knit Stockings about 2s. 4d. a pair.<br>
1 Pair Norwich Garters about 5s. a dozen.<br>
4 Shirts.<br>
2 Suits of Doublet and Hose; of leather lined with oiled skin
leather, the hose and doublet with hooks and eyes.<br>
1 Suit of Northern Dussens or Hampshire Kerseys lined, the hose

serges, 2s. 10d. a yard, 4-1/2 to 5 yards a suit.<br>
4 Bands.<br>
2 Plain falling bands.<br>
1 Standing band.<br>
1 Waistcoat of green cotton bound about with red tape.<br>
1 Leather Girdle.<br>
2 Monmouth Cap, about 2s. apiece.<br>

1 Pair Calfs Leather gloves (and some odd pairs of knit and sheeps
leather gloves).<br>
A number of Ells Sheer Linen for Handkerchiefs.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>On March 16th was added to this list a mandillion lined with cotton at
12d. a yard. Also breeches and waistcoats; a leather suit of doublet and
breeches of oiled leather; a pair of breeches of leather, &quot;the drawers
to serve to wear with both their other suits.&quot; There was also full,
yes, generous for the day, provision of rugs, bedticks, bolsters, mats,
blankets, and sheets for the berths, and table linen. There were fifty
beds; evidently two men occupied each bed. Folk, even of wealth and
refinement, were not at all sensitive as to their mode of sleeping or their
bedfellows. The pages of Pepys's <i>Diary</i> give ample examples of this
carelessness.</p>

<p>Arms and armor were also furnished, as will be explained in a later
chapter.</p>

<p>A private letter written by an engineer, one Master Graves, the
following year (1630), giving a list of &quot;such needful things as every
planter ought to provide,&quot; affords a more curt and much less expensive
list, though this has three full suits, two being of wool stuffs:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;1 Monmouth Cap.<br>
3 Falling Bands.<br>
3 Shirts.<br>
1 Waistcoat.<br>
1 Suit Canvass.<br>
1 Suit Frieze.<br>
1 Suit of Cloth.<br>
3 Pair of Stockings.<br>
4 Pair of Shoes.<br>
Armour complete.<br>
Sword &amp; Belt.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>The underclothing in this outfit seems very scanty.</p>

<p>I am sure that to some of the emigrants on these ships either outfit
afforded an ampler wardrobe than they had known theretofore in England,
though English folk of that day were well dressed. With a little
consideration we can see that the Massachusetts Bay apparel was adequate
for all occasions, but it was far different from a man's dress to-day. The
colonist &quot;hadn't a coat to his back&quot;; nor had he a pair of
trousers. Some had not even a pair of breeches. It was a time when great
changes in dress were taking place. The ancient gown had just been
abandoned for doublet and long hose, which were still in high esteem,
especially among &quot;the elder sort,&quot; with garters or points for the
knees. These doublets were both of leather and wool. And there were also
doublets to be worn by younger men with breeches and stockings.</p>

<p>When doublet and hose were worn, the latter were, of course, the long,
Florentine hose, somewhat like our modern tights.</p>

<p>The jerkin of other lists varied little from the doublet; both were
often sleeveless, and the cassock in turn was different only in being
longer; buff-coat and horseman's coat were slightly changed. The evolution
of doublet, jerkin, and cassock into a man's coat is a long enough story
for a special chapter, and one which took place just while America was
being settled. Let me explain here that, while the general arrangement of
this book is naturally chronological, we halt upon our progress at times,
to review a certain aspect of dress, as, for instance, the riding-dress of
women, or the dress of the Quakers, or to review the description of certain
details of dress in a consecutive account. We thus run on ahead of our
story sometimes; and other times, topics have to be resumed and reviewed
near the close of the book.</p>

<p>The breeches worn by the early planters were fulled at the waist and
knee, after the Dutch fashion, somewhat like our modern knickerbockers or
the English bag-breeches.</p>

<p>The four pairs of shoes furnished to the colonists were the best. In
another entry the specifications of their make are given thus:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Welt Neats Leather shoes crossed on the out-side with a
seam. To be substantial good over-leather of the best, and two soles; the
under sole of Neats-leather, the outer sole of tallowed
backs.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>They were to be of ample size, some thirteen inches long; each reference
to them insisted upon good quality.</p>

<p>There is plentiful head-gear named in these inventories,--six caps and a
hat for each man, at a time when Englishmen thought much and deeply upon
what they wore to cover their heads, and at a time when hats were very
costly. I give due honor to those hats in an entire chapter, as I do to the
ruffs and bands supplied in such adequate and dignified numbers. There was
an unusually liberal supply of shirts, and there were drawers which are
believed to have been draw-strings for the breeches.</p>

<p>In <i>New England's First Fruits</i> we read instructions to bring over
&quot;good Irish stockings, which if they are good are much more
serviceable than knit ones.&quot; There appears to have been much variety
in shape as well as in material. John Usher, writing in 1675 to England,
says, &quot;your sherrups stockings and your turn down stocking are not
salable here.&quot; Nevertheless, stirrup stockings and socks were
advertised in the Boston News Letter as late as January 30, 1731.
Stirrup-hose are described in 1658 as being very wide at the top--two yards
wide--and edged with points or eyelet holes by which they were made fast to
the girdle or bag-breeches. Sometimes they were allowed to bag down over
the garter. They are said to have been worn on horseback to protect the
other garments.</p>

<p>Stockings at that time were made of cotton and woollen cloth more than
they were knitted. Calico stockings are found in inventories, and often
stockings as well as hose with calico linings. In the clothing of William
Wright of Plymouth, at his death in 1633, were</p>

<blockquote>&quot;2 Pair Old Knit Stockins.<br>
2 Pair Old Yrish Stockins.<br>
2 Pair Cloth Stockins.<br>
2 Pair Wadmoll Stockins.<br>
4 Pair Linnen Stockins,&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>which would indicate that Goodman Wright had stockings for all weathers,
or, as said a list of that day, &quot;of all denominations.&quot; He had
also two pair of boot-hose and two pair of boot-briches; evidently he was a
seafaring man. I must note that he had more ample underclothing than many
&quot;plain citizens,&quot; having cotton drawers and linen drawers and
dimity waistcoats.</p>

<p>That petty details of propriety and dignity of dress were not forgotten;
that the articles serving to such dignity were furnished to the colonists,
and the use of these articles was expected of them, is shown by the supply
of such additions to dress as Norwich garters. Garters had been a
decorative and elegant ornament to dress, as may be seen by glancing at the
portraits of Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Robert Orchard, and the <i>English
Antick</i>, in this book. And they might well have been decried as
offensive luxuries unmeet for any Puritan and unnecessary for any colonist;
yet here they are. The settlers in one of the closely following ships had
points for the knee as well as garters.</p>

<p>From all this cheerful and ample dress, this might well be a Cavalier
emigration; in truth, the apparel supplied as an outfit to the Virginia
planters (who are generally supposed to be far more given over to rich
dress) is not as full nor as costly as this apparel of Massachusetts Bay.
In this as in every comparison I make, I find little to indicate any
difference between Puritan and Cavalier in quantity of garments, in
quality, or cost--or, indeed, in form. The differences in England were much
exaggerated in print; in America they often existed wholly in men's notions
of what a Puritan must be.</p>

<p>At first the English Puritan reformers made marked alterations in dress;
and there were also distinct changes in the soldiers of Cromwell's army,
but in neither case did rigid reforms prove permanent, nor were they ever
as great or as sweeping as the changes which came to the Cavalier dress.
Many of the extremes preached in Elizabeth's day had disappeared before New
England was settled; they had been abandoned as unwise or unnecessary;
others had been adopted by Cavaliers, so that equalized all differences. I
find it difficult to pick out with accuracy Puritan or Cavalier in any
picture of a large gathering. Let us glance at the Puritan Roundhead, at
Cromwell himself. His picture is given <a
href="#Cromwell_dissolving_Parliament.">here</a>, cut from a famous print
of his day, which represents Cromwell dissolving the Long Parliament. He
and his three friends, all Puritan leaders, are dressed in clothes as
distinctly Cavalier as the attire of the king himself. The graceful hats
with sweeping ostrich feathers are precisely like the Cavalier hats still
preserved in England; like one in the South Kensington Museum. Cromwell's
wide boots and his short cape all have a Cavalier aspect.</p>

<p>While Cromwell was steadily working for power, the fashion of plain
attire was being more talked about than at any other time; so he appeared
in studiously simple dress--the plainest apparel, indeed, of any man
prominent in affairs in English history. This is a description of his
appearance at a time before his name was in all Englishmen's mouths. It was
written by Sir Philip Warwick:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The first time I ever took notice of him (Cromwell) was
in the beginning of Parliament, November, 1640. I came into the house one
morning, well-clad, and perceived a gentleman speaking whom I knew not,
very ordinary apparelled, for it was a plain cloth suit which seemed to
have been made by an ill country tailor. His linen was plain and not very
clean, and I remember a speck or two of blood upon his band which was not
much larger than his collar; his hat was without a hat-band; his stature
was of good size; his sword stuck close to his side.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Lowell has written of what he terms verbal magic; the power of certain
words and sentences, apparently simple, and without any recognizable
quality, which will, nevertheless, fix themselves in our memory, or will
picture a scene to us which we can never forget. This description of
Cromwell has this magic. There is no apparent reason why these plain,
commonplace words should fix in my mind this simple, rough-hewn form; yet I
never can think of Cromwell otherwise than in this attire, and whatever
portrait I see of him, I instinctively look for the spot of blood on his
band. I know of his rich dress after he was in power; of that splendid
purple velvet suit in which he lay majestic in death; but they never seem
to me to be Cromwell--he wears forever an ill-cut, clumsy cloth suit, a
close sword, and rumpled linen.</p>

<p>The noble portraits of Cromwell by the miniaturist, Samuel Cooper,
especially the one which is at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, are held
to be the truest likenesses. They show a narrow band, but the hair curls
softly on the shoulders. The wonderful portrait of the Puritan General
Ireton, in the National Portrait Gallery, has beautiful, long hair, and a
velvet suit much slashed, and with many loops and buttons at the slashes.
He wears mustache and imperial. We expect we may find that friend of
Puritanism, Lucius Carey, Lord Falkland, in rich dress; and we find him in
the richest of dress; namely, a doublet made, as to its body and large full
sleeves, wholly of bands an inch or two wide of embroidery and gold lace,
opening like long slashes from throat to waist, and from arm-scye to wrist
over fine white lawn, and with extra slashes at various spots, with the
full white lawn of his &quot;habit-shirt&quot; pulled out in pretty puffs.
His hair is long and curling. General Waller of Cromwell's army, here
shown, is the very figure of a Cavalier, as handsome a face, with as
flowing hair and careful mustache, as the Duke of Buckingham, or Mr.
Endymion Porter,--that courtier of courtiers,--gentleman of the bed-chamber
to Charles I. Cornet Joyce, the sturdy personal custodian of the king in
captivity, came the closest to being a Roundhead; but even his hair covers
his ear and hangs over his collar--it would be deemed over-long to-day.</p>

<p>Here is Lord Fairfax in plain buff coat slightly laced and slashed with
white satin. Fanshawe dressed--so his wife tells us--in &quot;phillamot
brocade with 9 Laces every one as broad as my hand, a little gold and
silver lace between and both of curious workmanship.&quot; And his suit was
gay with scarlet knots of ribbon; and his legs were cased in white silk
hose over scarlet ones; and he wore black shoes with scarlet shoe strings
and scarlet roses and garters; and his gloves were trimmed with scarlet
ribbon--a fine &quot;gaybeseen&quot;--to use Chaucer's words.</p>

<p>Surprising to all must be the portrait of that Puritan figurehead, the
Earl of Leicester; for he wears an affected double-peaked beard, a great
ruff, feathered hat, richly jewelled hatband and collar, and an ear-ring.
Shown <a href="#ROBERT_DEVEREUX">here</a> is the dress he wore when
masquerading in Holland as general during the Netherland insurrection
against Philip II.</p>

<p>It is strange to find even writers of intelligence calling Winthrop and
Endicott Roundheads. A recent magazine article calls Myles Standish a
Roundhead captain. That term was not invented till a score of years after
Myles Standish landed at Plymouth. A political song printed in 1641 is
entitled <i>The Character of a Roundhead</i>. It begins:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;What creature's this with his short hairs<br>
His little band and huge long ears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That this new faith hath founded?<br>
<br>
&quot;The Puritans were never such,<br>
The saints themselves had ne'er as much.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, such a knave's a Roundhead.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Lucy Hutchinson was the wife of a Puritan gentleman, who was
colonel in Cromwell's army, and one of the regicide judges. She wrote a
history of her husband's life, which is one of the most valuable sources of
information of the period wherein he lived, the day when Cromwell and
Hampden acted, when Laud and Strafford suffered. In this history she tells
explicitly of the early use of the word Roundhead:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The name of Roundhead coming so opportunely, I shall make
a little digression to show how it came up: When Puritanism grew a faction,
the Zealots distinguished themselves by several affectations of habit,
looks and words, which had it been a real forsaking of vanity would have
been most commendable. Among other affected habits, few of the Puritans,
what degree soever they were, wore their hair long enough to cover their
ears; and the ministers and many others cut it close around their heads
with so many little peaks--as was something ridiculous to behold. From this
custom that name of Roundhead became the scornful term given to the whole
Parliament Party, whose army indeed marched out as if they had only been
sent out till their hair was grown. Two or three years later any stranger
that had seen them would have inquired the meaning of that
name.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>It is a pleasure to point out Colonel Hutchinson as a Puritan, though
there was little in his dress to indicate the significance of such a name
for him, and certainly he was not a Roundhead, with his light brown hair
&quot;softer than the finest silk and curling in great loose rings at the
ends--a very fine, thick-set head of hair.&quot; He loved dancing, fencing,
shooting, and hawking; he was a charming musician; he had judgment in
painting, sculpture, architecture, and the &quot;liberal arts.&quot; He
delighted in books and in gardening and in all rarities; in fact, he seemed
to care for everything that was &quot;lovely and of good report.&quot;
&quot;He was wonderfully neat, cleanly and genteel in his habit, and had a
very good fancy in it, but he left off very early the wearing of anything
very costly, yet in his plainest habit appeared very much a
gentleman.&quot; Such dress was the <i>best</i> of Puritan dress; just as
he was the best type of a Puritan. He was cheerful, witty, happy, eager,
earnest, vivacious--a bit quick in temper, but kind, generous, and good. He
was, in truth, what is best of all,--a noble, consistent, Christian
gentleman.</p>

<p>Those who have not acquired from accurate modern portrayal and
representation their whole notion of the dress of the early colonists have,
I find, a figure in their mind's eye something like that of Matthew Hopkins
the witch-finder. Hogarth's illustrations of Hudibras give similar
Puritans. Others have figures, dull and plainly dressed, from the pictures
in some book of saints and martyrs of the Puritan church, such as were
found in many an old New England home. <i>My</i> Puritan is reproduced <a
href="#Alderman_Abell_and_Richard_Kilvert">here</a>. I have found in later
years that this Alderman Abel of my old print was quite a character in
English history; having been given with Cousin Kilvert the monopoly of the
sale of wines at retail, one of those vastly lucrative privileges which
brought forth the bitterest denunciations from Sir John Eliot, who regarded
them as an infamous imposition upon the English people. The site of Abel's
house had once belonged to Cardinal Wolsey; and it was popularly believed
that Abel found and used treasure of the cardinal which had been hidden in
his cellar. He was called the &quot;Main Projector and Patentee for the
Raising of Wines.&quot; Unfortunately for my theory that Abel was a typical
Puritan, he was under the protection of King Charles I; and Cromwell's
Parliament put an end to his monopoly in 1641, and his dress was simply
that of any dull, uninteresting, commonplace, and common Englishman of his
day.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Another New England man who is constantly called a Roundhead is Cotton
Mather; with equal inconsequence and inaccuracy he is often referred to,
and often stigmatized, as &quot;the typical Puritan colonist,&quot; a
narrow, bigoted Gospeller. I have open before me an editorial from a
reputable newspaper which speaks of Cotton Mather dressed in dingy,
skimped, sad-colored garments &quot;shivering in the icy air of Plymouth as
he uncovered his close-clipped Round-head when he landed on the Rock from
the <i>Mayflower</i>.&quot; He was in fact born in America; he was not a
Plymouth man, and did not die till more than a century after the landing of
the <i>Mayflower</i>, and, of course, he was not a Roundhead. Another
drawing of Cotton Mather, in a respectable magazine, depicts him with
clipped hair, emaciated, clad in clumsy garments, mean and haggard in
countenance, raising a bundle of rods over a cowering Indian child. Now,
Cotton Mather was distinctly handsome, as may be seen from his picture <a
href="#Reverend_Cotton_Mather.">here</a>, which displays plainly the full,
sensual features of the Cotton family, shown in John Cotton's portrait. And
the Roundhead is in an elegant, richly curled periwig, such as was
fashionable a hundred years after the <i>Mayflower</i>. And though he had
the tormenting Puritan conscience he was not wholly a Puritan, for the
world, the flesh, and the devil were strong in him. He was much more gentle
and tender than men of that day were in general; especially with all
children, white and Indian, and was most conscientious in his relations
both to Indians and negroes. And in those days of universal whippings by
English and American schoolmasters and parents, he spoke in no uncertain
voice his horror and disapproval of the rod for children, and never
countenanced or permitted any whippings.</p>

<p>There was certainly great diversity in dress among those who called
themselves Puritans. Some amusing stories are told of that strange,
restless, brilliant creature, the major-general of Cromwell's
army,--Harrison. When the first-accredited ambassador sent by any great
nation to the new republic came to London, there was naturally some stir as
to the wisdom of certain details of demeanor and dress. It was a ticklish
time. The new Commonwealth must command due honor, and the day before the
audience a group of Parliament gentlemen, among them Colonel Hutchinson and
one who was afterwards the Earl of Warwick, were seated together when
Harrison came in and spoke of the coming audience, and admonished them
all--and Hutchinson in particular, &quot;who was in a habit pretty rich but
grave and none other than he usually wore&quot;--that, now nations sent to
them, they must &quot;shine in wisdom and piety, not in gold and silver and
worldly bravery which did not become saints.&quot; And he asked them not to
appear before the ambassador in &quot;gorgeous habits.&quot; So the
colonel--though he was not &quot;convinced of any misbecoming bravery in a
suit of sad-coloured cloth trimmed with gold and with silver points and
buttons&quot;--still conformed to his comrade's opinion, and appeared as
did all the other gentlemen in solemn, handsome black. When who should come
in, &quot;all in red and gold-a,&quot;--in scarlet coat and cloak laden
with gold and silver, &quot;the coat so covered with clinquant one could
scarcely discern the ground,&quot; and in this gorgeous and glittering
habit seat himself alone just under the speaker's chair and receive the
specially low respects and salutes of all in the ambassador's train,--who
should thus blazon and brazon and bourgeon forth but Harrison! I presume,
though Hutchinson was a Puritan and a saint, he was a bit chagrined at his
black suit of garments, and a bit angered at being thus decoyed; and it
touched Madam Hutchinson deeply.</p>

<p>But Hutchinson had his turn to wear gay clothes. A great funeral was to
be given to Ireton, who was his distant kinsman; yet Cromwell, from
jealousy, sent no bidding or mourning suit to him. A general invitation and
notice was given to the whole assembly, and on the hour of the funeral,
within the great, gloomy state-chamber, hung in funereal black, and filled
with men in trappings of woe, covered with great black cloaks with long,
weeping hatbands drooping to the ground, in strode Hutchinson; this time he
was in scarlet and cliquante, &quot;such as he usually wore,&quot;--so
wrote his wife,--astonishing the eyes of all, especially the diplomats and
ambassadors who were present, who probably deemed him of so great station
as to be exempt from wearing black. The master of ceremonies timidly
regretted to him, in hesitating words, that no mourning had been sent--it
had been in some way overlooked; the General could not, thus unsuitably
dressed, follow the coffin in the funeral procession--it would not look
well; the master of ceremonies would be rebuked--all which proved he did
not know Hutchinson, for follow he could, and would, and did, in this rich
dress. And he walked through the streets and stood in the Abbey, with his
scarlet cloak flaunting and fluttering like a gay tropical bird in the
midst of a slowly flying, sagging flock of depressed black crows,--you have
seen their dragging, heavy flight,--and was looked upon with admiration and
love by the people as a splendid and soldierly figure.</p>

<p>We must not forget that the years which saw the settlement of Salem and
Boston were not under the riot of dress countenanced by James. Charles I
was then on the throne; and the rich and beautiful dress worn by that king
had already taken shape.</p>

<p>There has been an endeavor made to attribute this dress to the stimulus,
to the influence, of Puritan feeling. Possibly some of the reaction against
the absurdities of Elizabeth and James may have helped in the establishment
of this costume; but I think the excellent taste of Charles and especially
of his queen, Henrietta Maria, who succeeded in making women's dress wholly
beautiful, may be thanked largely for it. And we may be grateful to the
painter Van Dyck; for he had not only great taste as to dress, and genius
in presenting his taste to the public, but he had a singular appreciation
of the pictorial quality of dress and a power of making dress appropriate
to the wearer. And he fully understood its value in indicating
character.</p>

<p>Since Van Dyck formed and painted these fine and elegant modes, they are
known by his name,--it is the Van Dyck costume. We have ample exposition of
it, for his portraits are many. It is told that he painted forty portraits
of the king and thirty of the queen, and many of the royal children. There
are nine portraits by his hand of the Earl of Strafford, the king's friend.
He painted the Earl of Arundel seven times. Venetia, Lady Digby, had four
portraits in one year. He painted all persons of fashion, many of
distinction and dignity, and some with no special reason for consideration
or portrayal.</p>

<p>The Van Dyck dress is a gallant dress, one fitted for a court, not for
everyday life, nor for a strenuous life, though men of such aims wore it.
The absurdity of Elizabeth's day is lacking; the richness remains. It is a
dress distinctly expressive of dignity. The doublet is of some rich, silken
stuff, usually satin or velvet. The sleeves are loose and graceful; at one
time they were slashed liberally to show the fine, full, linen
shirt-sleeve. Here are a number of slashed sleeves, from portraits of the
day, painted by Van Dyck. The cuffs of the doublet are often turned back
deeply to show embroidered shirt cuffs or lace ruffles, or even linen
undersleeves. The collar of the doublet was wholly covered with a band or
collar of rich lace and lawn, or all lace; this usually with the pointed
edges now termed Vandykes. Band strings of ribbon or &quot;snake-bone&quot;
were worn. These often had jewelled tassels. Rich tassels of pearl were the
favorite. A short cloak was thrown gracefully on one shoulder or hung at
the back. Knee-breeches edged with points or fringes or ribbons met the
tops of wide, high boots of Spanish leather, which often also turned over
with ruffles of leather or lace. Within-doors silken hose and shoes with
rich shoe-roses of lace or ribbon were worn. A great hat, broad-leafed,
often of Flemish beaver, had a splendid feather and jewelled hatband. A
rich sword-belt and gauntleted and fringed gloves were added. A peaked
beard with small upturned mustache formed a triangle, with the mouth in the
centre, as in the portrait of General Waller. The hair curled loosely in
the neck, and was rarely, I think, powdered.</p>

<p>Other great painters besides Van Dyck were fortunately in England at the
time this dress was worn, and the king was a patron and appreciator of art.
Hence they were encouraged in their work; and every form and detail of this
beautiful costume is fully depicted for us.</p> <br>

part.&quot;</i><br><br>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>DRESS OF THE NEW ENGLAND MOTHERS</h3>
<p style='text-indent: 0em'> <img src="images\initiali.png" align=left
alt="I"> &nbsp; have expressed a doubt that the dress of Cavalier and
Puritan varied as much as has been popularly believed; I feel sure that the
dress of Puritan women did not differ from the attire of women of quiet
life who remained in the Church of England; nor did it vary materially
either in form or quality from the attire of the sensible followers of
court life. It simply did not extend to the extreme of the mode in gay
color, extravagance, or grotesqueness. In the first severity of revolt over
the dissoluteness of English life which had shown so plainly in the
extravagance and absurdity of English court dress, many persons of deep
thought (especially men), both of the Church of England and of the Puritan
faith, expressed their feeling by a change in their dress. Doubtless also
in some the extremity of feeling extended to fanaticism. It is always thus
in reforms; the slow start becomes suddenly a violent rush which needs to
be retarded and moderated, and it always is moderated. I have referred to
one exhibition of bigotry in regard to dress which is found in the annals
of Puritanism; it is detailed in the censure and attempt at restraint of
the dress of Madam Johnson, the wife of the Rev. Francis Johnson, the
pastor of the exiles to Holland.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that Parson Johnson was one of the Marprelate
brotherhood, who certainly deserved the imprisonment they received, were it
only for their ill-spelling and ill-use of their native tongue. The
Marprelate pamphlet before me as I write had an author who could not even
spell the titles of the prelates it assailed; but called them
&quot;parsones, fyckers and currats,&quot; the latter two names being
intended for vicars and curates. The story of Madam Johnson's revolt, and
her triumph, is preserved to us in such real and earnest language, and was
such a vital thing to the actors in the little play, that it seems almost
irreverent to regard it as a farce, yet none to-day could read of it
without a sense of absurdity, and we may as well laugh frankly and freely
at the episode.</p>

<p>When the protagonist of this Puritan comedy entered the stage, she was a
widow--Tomison or Thomasine Boyes, a &quot;warm&quot; widow, as the saying
of the day ran, that is, warm with a comfortable legacy of ready money. She
was a young widow, and she was handsome. At any rate, it was brought up
against her when events came to a climax; it was testified in the church
examination or trial that &quot;men called her a bouncing girl,&quot; as if
she could help that! Husband Boyes had been a haberdasher, and I fancy she
got both her finery and her love of finery in his shop. And it was told
with all the petty terms of scandal-mongering that might be heard in a
small shop in a small English town to-day; it was told very gravely that
the &quot;clarkes in the shop&quot; compared her for her pride in apparel
to the wife of the Bishop of London, and it was affirmed that she stood
&quot;gazing, braving, and vaunting in shop doores.&quot;</p>

<p>Now this special complaint against the Widow Boyes, that she stood
braving and vaunting in shop doors, was not a far-fetched attack brought as
a novelty of tantalizing annoyance; it touches in her what was one of the
light carriages of the day, which were so detestable to sober and
thoughtful folk, an odious custom specified by Stubbes in his <i>Anatomy of
Abuses</i>. He writes thus of London women, the wives of merchants:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Othersome spend the greater part of the daie in sittyng
at the doore, to shewe their braveries, to make knowen their beauties, to
behold the passers by; to view the coast, to see fashions, and to acquaint
themselves of the bravest fellows--for, if not for these causes, I know no
other causes why they should sitt at their doores--as many doe from Morning
till Noon, from Noon till Night.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Other writers give other reasons for this &quot;vaunting.&quot; We learn
that &quot;merchants' wives had seats built a purpose&quot; to sit in, in
order to lure customers. Marston in <i>The Dutch Courtesan</i> says:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;His wife's a proper woman--that she is! She has been as
proper a woman as any in the Chepe. She paints now, and yet she keeps her
husband's old customers to him still. In troth, a fine-fac'd wife in a
wainscot-carved seat, is a worthy ornament to any tradesman's shop. And an
attractive one I'le warrant.&quot;<br> </blockquote>

<p>This handsome, buxom, bouncing widow fell in love with Pastor Johnson,
and he with her, while he was &quot;a prisoner in the Clink,&quot; he
having been thrown therein by the Archbishop of Canterbury for his
persistent preaching of Puritanism. Many of his friends &quot;thought this
not a good match&quot; for him at any time; and all deemed it ill advised
for a man in prison to pledge himself in matrimony to any one. And soon
zealous and meddlesome Brother George Johnson took a hand in advice and
counsel, with as high a hand as if Francis had been a child instead of a
man of thirty-two, and a man of experience as well, and likewise older than
George.</p>

<p>George at first opened warily, saying in his letters that &quot;he was
very loth to contrary his brother;&quot; still Brother Francis must be
sensible that this widow was noted for her pride and vanity, her light and
garish dress, and that it would give great offence to all Puritans if he
married her, and &quot;it (the vanity and extravagance, etc.) should not be
refrained.&quot; There was then some apparent concession and yielding on
the widow's part, for George for a time &quot;sett down satysfyed&quot;;
when suddenly, to his &quot;great grief&quot; and discomfiture, he found
that his brother had been &quot;inveigled and overcarried,&quot; and the
sly twain had been married secretly in prison.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that this was in the last years of Elizabeth's
reign, in 1596, when the laws were rigid in attempts at limitation of
dress, as I shall note later in this chapter. But there were certain
privileges of large estate, even if the owner were of mean birth; and Madam
Johnson certainly had money enough to warrant her costly apparel, and in
ready cash also, from Husband Boyes. But in the first good temper and
general good will of the honeymoon she &quot;obeyed&quot;; she promised to
dress as became her husband's condition, which would naturally mean much
simpler attire. He was soon in very bad case for having married without
permission of the archbishop, and was still more closely confined
within-walls; but even while he lingered in prison, Brother George saw with
anguish that the bride's short obedience had ended. She appeared in
&quot;more garish and proud apparell&quot; than he had ever before seen
upon the widow,--naturally enough for a bride,--even the bride of a
bridegroom in prison; but he &quot;dealt with her that she would
refrain&quot;--poor, simple man! She dallied on, tantalizing him and daring
him, and she was very &quot;bold in inviting proof,&quot; but never
quitting her bridal finery for one moment; so George read to her with
emphasis, as a final and unconquerable weapon, that favorite wail of all
men who would check or reprove an extravagant woman, namely, Isaiah iii, 16
<i>et seq</i>., the chapter called by Mercy Warren</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;... An antiquated page<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That taught us the threatenings of an Hebrew sage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gainst wimples, mantles, curls and crisping pins.&quot;<br>

<p>I wonder how many Puritan parsons have preached fatuously upon those
verses! how many defiant women have had them read to them--and how many
meek ones! I knew a deacon's wife in Worcester, some years ago, who asked
for a new pair of India-rubber overshoes, and in pious response her frugal
partner slapped open the great Bible at this favorite third chapter of the
lamenting and threatening prophet, and roared out to his poor little wife,
sitting meekly before him in calico gown and checked apron, the lesson of
the haughty daughters of Zion walking with stretched-forth necks and
tinkling feet; of their chains and bracelets and mufflers; their bonnets
and rings and rich jewels; their mantles and wimples and crisping-pins;
their fair hoods and veils--oh, how she must have longed for an Oriental
husband!</p>

<p>Petulant with his new sister-in-law's successful evasions of his
readings, his letters, and his advice, his instructions, his pleadings, his
commands, and &quot;full of sauce and zeal&quot; like Elnathan, George
Johnson, in emulation of the prophet Isaiah, made a list of the offences of
this London &quot;daughter of Zion,&quot; wrote them out, and presented
them to the congregation. She wore &quot;3, 4, or even 5 gold rings at one
time&quot; Then likewise &quot;her Busks and ye Whalebones at her Brest
were soe manifest that many of ye Saints were greeved thereby.&quot; She
was asked to &quot;pull off her Excessive Deal of Lace.&quot; And she was
fairly implored to &quot;exchange ye Schowish Hatt for a sober Taffety or
Felt.&quot; She was ordered severely &quot;to discontinue Whalebones,&quot;
and to &quot;quit ye great starcht Ruffs, ye Muske, and ye Rings.&quot; And
not to wear her bodice tied to her petticoat &quot;as men do their doublets
to their hose contrary to I Thessalonians, V, 22.&quot; And a certain
stomacher or neckerchief he plainly called &quot;abominable and
loathsome.&quot; A &quot;schowish Velvet Hood,&quot; such as only &quot;the
richest, finest and proudest sort should use,&quot; was likewise beyond
endurance, almost beyond forgiveness, and other &quot;gawrish gear gave him
grave greevance.&quot;</p>

<p>But here the young husband interfered, as it was high time he should;
and he called his brother &quot;fantasticall, fond, ignorant,
anabaptisticall and such like,&quot; though what the poor Anabaptists had
to do with such dress quarrels I know not. George's cautious reference in
his letter to the third verse of the third chapter of Jeremiah made the
parson call it &quot;the Abhominablest Letter ever was written.&quot;
George, a bit frightened, answered pacificatorily that he noted of late
that &quot;the excessive lace upon the sleeve of her dress had a Cover
drawn upon it;&quot; that the stomacher was not &quot;so gawrish, so low,
and so spitz-fashioned as it was wont to be&quot;; nor was her hat &quot;so
topishly set,&quot;--and he expressed pious gladness at the happy change,
&quot;hoping more would follow,&quot;--and for a time all did seem subdued.
But soon another meddlesome young man became &quot;greeved&quot; (did ever
any one hear of such a set of silly, grieving fellows?); and seeing
&quot;how heavily the young gentleman took it,&quot; stupid George must
interfere again, to be met this time very boldly by the bouncing girl
herself, who, he writes sadly, answered him in a tone &quot;very peert and
coppet.&quot; &quot;Coppet&quot; is a delightful old word which all our
dictionaries have missed; it signifies impudent, saucy, or, to be precise,
&quot;sassy,&quot; which we all know has a shade more of meaning.
&quot;Peert and coppet&quot; is a delightful characterization. George
refused to give the sad young complainer's name, who must have been well
ashamed of himself by this time, and was then reproached with being a
&quot;forestaller,&quot; a &quot;picker,&quot; and a &quot;quarrelous
meddler&quot;--and with truth.</p>

<p>During the action of this farce, all had gone from London into exile in
Holland. Then came the sudden trip to Newfoundland and the disastrous and
speedy return to Holland again. And through the misfortunes and the exiles,
the company drew more closely together, and gentle words prevailed; George
was &quot;sorie if he had overcarried himself&quot;; Madam &quot;was sure
if it were to do now, she would not so wear it.&quot; Still, she did not
offer her martinet of a brother-in-law a room to lodge in in her house,
though she had many rooms unused, and he needed shelter, whereat he
whimpered much; and soon he was charging her again &quot;with Muske as a
sin&quot; (musk was at that time in the very height of fashion in France)
and cavilling at her unbearable &quot;topish hat.&quot; Then came long
argument and sparring for months over &quot;topishness,&quot; which seems
to have been deemed a most offensive term. They told its nature and being;
they brought in Greek derivatives, and the pastor produced a syllogism upon
the word. And they declared that the hat in itself was not topish, but only
became so when she wore it, she being the wife of a preacher; and they
disputed over velvet and vanity; they bickered over topishness and
lightness; they wrangled about lawn coives and busks in a way that was sad
to read. The pastor argued soundly, logically, that both coives and busks
might be lawfully used; whereat one of his flock, Christopher Dickens, rose
up promptly in dire fright and dread of future extravagance among the
women-saints in the line of topish hats and coives and busks, and he
&quot;begged them not to speak so, and <i>so loud</i>, lest it should bring
<i>many inconveniences among their wives</i>.&quot; Finally the topish
head-gear was demanded in court, which the parson declared was
&quot;offensive&quot;; and so they bickered on till a most unseemly hour,
till <i>ten o'clock at night</i>, as &quot;was proved by the watchman and
rattleman coming about.&quot; Naturally they wished to go to bed at an
early hour, for religious services began at nine; one of the complaints
against the topish bride was that she was a &quot;slug-a-bed,&quot;
flippantly refused to rise and have her house ordered and ready for the
nine o'clock public service. The meetings were then held in the parson's
house, and held every day; which may have been one reason why the
settlement grew poorer. It matters little what was said, or how it ended,
since it did not disrupt and disband the Holland Pilgrims. For eleven years
this stupid wrangling lasted; and it seemed imminent that the settlement
would finish with a separation, and a return of many to England. Slight
events have great power--this topish hat of a vain and pretty, a peert and
coppet young Puritan bride came near to hindering and changing the
colonization of America.</p>

<p>I have related this episode at some length because its recounting makes
us enter into the spirit of the first Separatist settlers. It shows us too
that dress conquered zeal; it could not be &quot;forborne&quot; by
entreaty, by reproof, by discipline, by threats, by example. An influence,
or perhaps I should term it an echo, of this long quarrel is seen plainly
by the thoughtful mind in the sumptuary laws of the New World. Some of the
articles of dress so dreaded, so discussed in Holland, still threatened the
peace of Puritanical husbands in New England; they still dreaded many
inconveniences. In 1634, the general court of Massachusetts issued this
edict:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;That no person, man or woman, shall hereafter make or buy
any Apparell, either Woolen, or Silk, or Linen, with any Lace on it,
Silver, Gold, or Thread, under the penalty of forfeiture of said clothes.
Also that no person either man or woman, shall make or buy any Slashed
Clothes, other than one Slash in each Sleeve and another in the Back. Also
all Cut-works, embroideries, or Needlework Caps, Bands or Rails, are
forbidden hereafter to be made and worn under the aforesaid Penalty; also
all gold or silver Girdles Hat bands, Belts, Ruffs, Beaver hats are
prohibited to be bought and worn hereafter.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Fines were stated, also the amount of estate which released the
dress-wearer from restriction. Liberty was given to all to wear out the
apparel which they had on hand except &quot;immoderate great sleeves,
slashed apparell, immoderate great rails, and long wings&quot;--these being
beyond endurance.</p>

<p>In 1639 &quot;immoderate great breeches, knots of riban, broad shoulder
bands and rayles, silk roses, double ruffles and capes&quot; were forbidden
to folk of low estate. Soon the court expressed its &quot;utter detestation
and dislike,&quot; that men and women of &quot;mean condition, education
and calling&quot; should take upon themselves &quot;the garb of
gentlemen&quot; by wearing gold and silver lace, buttons and points at the
knee, or &quot;walk in great boots,&quot; or women of the same low rank to
wear silk or tiffany hoods or scarfs. There were likewise orders that no
short sleeves should be worn &quot;whereby the nakedness of the arms may be
discovered&quot;; women's sleeves were not to be more than half an ell
wide; long hair and immodest laying out of the hair and wearing borders of
hair were abhorrent. Poor folk must not appear with &quot;naked breasts and
arms; or as it were pinioned with superstitious ribbons on hair and
apparell.&quot; Tailors who made garments for servants or children, richer
than the garments of the parents or masters of these juniors, were to be
fined. Similar laws were passed in Connecticut and Virginia. I know of no
one being &quot;psented&quot; under these laws in Virginia, but in
Connecticut and Massachusetts both men and women were fined. In 1676, in
Northampton, thirty-six young women at one time were brought up for
overdress chiefly in hoods; and an amusing entry in the court record is
that one of them, Hannah Lyman, appeared in the very hood for which she was
fined; and was thereupon censured for &quot;wearing silk in a fflonting
manner, in an offensive way, not only before but when she stood Psented.
Not only in Ordinary but Extraordinary times.&quot; These girls were all
fined; but six years later, when a stern magistrate attempted a similar
persecution, the indictments were quashed.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to find the careless observer or the superficial
reader--and writer--commenting upon the sumptuary laws of the New World as
if they were extraordinary and peculiar. There appeared in a recent
American magazine a long rehearsal of the unheard-of presumption of Puritan
magistrates in their prohibition of certain articles of dress. This writer
was evidently wholly ignorant of the existence of similar laws in England,
and even of like laws in Virginia, but railed against Winthrop and Endicott
as monsters of Puritanical arrogance and impudence.</p>

<p>In truth, however, such laws had existed not only in France and England,
but since the days of the old Locrian legislation, when it was ordered that
no woman should go attended with more than one maid in the street
&quot;unless she were drunk.&quot; Ancient Rome and Sparta were surrounded
by dress restrictions which were broken just as were similar ones in more
modern times. The Roman could wear a robe but of a single color; he could
wear in embroideries not more than half an ounce of gold; and, with what
seems churlishness he was forbidden to ride in a carriage. At that time,
just as in later days, dress was made to emphasize class distinction, and
the clergy joined with the magistrates in denouncing extravagant dress in
both men and women. The chronicles of the monks are ever chiding men for
their peaked shoes, deep sleeves and curled locks like women, and
Savonarola outdid them all in severity. The English kings and queens,
jealous of the rich dress of their opulent subjects, multiplied
restrictions, and some very curious anecdotes exist of the calm assumption
by both Elizabeth and Mary to their own wardrobe of the rich finery of some
lady at the court who displayed some new and too becoming fancy.</p>

<p>Adam Smith declared it &quot;an act of highest impertinence and
presumption for kings and rulers to pretend to watch over the earnings and
expenditure of private persons,&quot; nevertheless this public interference
lingered long, especially under monarchies.</p>

<p>These sumptuary laws of New England followed in spirit and letter
similar laws in England. Winthrop had seen the many apprentices who ran
through London streets, dressed under laws as full of details of dress as
is a modern journal of the modes. For instance, the apprentice's
head-covering must be a small, flat, round cap, called often a bonnet--a
hat like a pie-dish. The facing of the hat could not exceed three inches in
breadth in the head; nor could the hat with band and facing cost over five
shillings. His band or collar could have no lace edge; it must be of linen
not over five shillings an ell in price; and could have no other work or
ornament save &quot;a plain hem and one stitch&quot;--which was a
hemstitch. If he wore a ruff, it must not be over three inches wide before
it was gathered and set into the &quot;stock.&quot; The collar of his
doublet could have neither &quot;point, well-bone or plait,&quot; but must
be made &quot;close and comely.&quot; The stuff of his doublet and breeches
could not cost over two shillings and sixpence a yard. It could be either
cloth, kersey, fustian, sackcloth, canvas, or &quot;English stuff&quot;; or
leather could be used. The breeches were generally of the shape known as
&quot;round slops.&quot; His stockings could be knit or of cloth; but his
shoes could have no polonia heels. His hair was to be cut close, with no
&quot;tuft or lock.&quot;</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth stood no nonsense in these things; finding that London
'prentices had adopted a certain white stitching for their collars, she put
a stop to this mild finery by ordering the first transgressor to be whipped
publicly in the hall of his company. These same laws, tinkered and altered
to suit occasions, appear for many years in English records, for years
after New England's sumptuary laws were silenced.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Hannah Lyman and the thirty-six vain Northampton girls,
we do not on the whole hear great complaint of extravagance in dress or
deportment. At any rate none were called bouncing girls. The portraits of
men or women certainly show no restraint as to richness in dress. Their
sumptuary laws were of less use to their day than to ours, for they do
reveal to us what articles of dress our forbears wore.</p>

<p>While the Massachusetts magistrates were fussing a little over woman's
dress, the parsons, as a whole, were remarkably silent. Of course two or
three of them could not refrain from announcing a text from Isaiah iii, 16
<i>et seq</i>., and enlarging upon the well-worn wimples and nose jewels,
and bells on their feet, which were as much out of fashion in Massachusetts
then as now. It is such a well-rounded, ringing, colorful arraignment of
woman's follies you couldn't expect a parson to give it up. Every evil
predicted of the prophet was laid at the door of these demure Puritan
dames,--fire and war, and caterpillars, and even baldness, which last was
really unjust. Solomon Stoddard preached on the &quot;Intolerable Pride in
the Plantations in Clothes and Hair,&quot; that his parishioners &quot;drew
iniquity with a cord of vanity and sin with a cart-rope.&quot; The apostle
Paul also furnished ample texts for the Puritan preacher.</p>

<p>In the eleventh chapter of Corinthians wise Paul delivered some
sentences of exhortation, of reproof, of warning to Corinthian women which
I presume he understood and perhaps Corinthian dames did, but which have
been a dire puzzle since to parsons and male members of their
congregations. (I cannot think that women ever bothered much about his
words.) For instance, Archbishop Latimer, in one of the cheerful, slangy
rallies to his hearers which he called sermons, quotes Paul's sentence that
a woman ought to have a power on her head, and construes positively that a
power is a French hood. This is certainly a somewhat surprising notion, but
I presume he knew. However, Roger Williams deemed a power a veil; and being
somewhat dictatorial in his words, albeit the tenderest of creatures in his
heart, he bade Salem women come to meeting in a veil, telling them they
should come like Sarah of old, wearing this veil as a token of submission
to their husbands. The text saith this exactly, &quot;A woman ought to have
power on her head because of the angels,&quot; which seems to me one of
those convenient sayings of Paul and others which can be twisted to many,
to any meanings, even to Latimer's French hood. Old John Cotton, of course,
found ample Scripture to prove Salem women should not wear veils, and so
here in this New World, as in the Holland sojourn, the head-covering of the
mothers rent in twain the meetings of the fathers, while the women wore
veils or no veils, French hoods or beaver hats, in despite of Paul's
opinions and their husbands' constructions of his opinions.</p>

<p>An excellent description of the Puritan women of a dissenting
congregation is in <i>Hudibras Redivivus;</i> it reads:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The good old dames among the rest<br>
Were all most primitively drest<br>
In stiffen-bodyed russet gowns<br>
And on their heads old steeple crowns<br>
With pristine pinners next their faces<br>
Edged round with ancient scallop-laces,<br>
Such as, my antiquary says,<br>
Were worn in old Queen Bess's days,<br>
In ruffs; and fifty other ways<br>
Their wrinkled necks were covered o'er<br>
With whisks of lawn by granmarms wore.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>The &quot;old steeple crowns&quot; over &quot;pristine pinners&quot;
were not peculiar to the Puritans. There was a time, in the first years of
the seventeenth century, when many Englishwomen wore steeple-crowned hats
with costly hatbands. We find them in pictures of women of the court, as
well as upon the heads of Puritans. I have a dozen prints and portraits of
Englishwomen in rich dress with these hats. The Quaker Tub-preacher, shown
<a href="#The_Tub-preacher.">here</a>, wears one. Perhaps the best known
example to Americans may be seen in the portrait of Pocahontas <a
href="#Pocahontas.">here</a>.</p>

<p>Authentic portraits of American women who came in the <i>Mayflower</i>
or in the first ships to the Massachusetts Bay settlement, there are none
to my knowledge. Some exist which are doubtless of that day, but cannot be
certified. One preserved in Connecticut in the family of Governor Eaton
shows a brown old canvas like a Rembrandt. The subject is believed to be of
the Yale family, and the chief and most distinct feature of dress is the
ruff.</p>

<p>It was a time of change both of men's and women's neckwear. A few older
women clung to the ruffs of their youth; younger women wore bands,
falling-bands, falls, rebatoes, falling-whisks and whisks, the &quot;fifty
other ways&quot; which could be counted everywhere. Carlyle says:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;There are various traceable small threads of relation,
interesting reciprocities and mutabilities connecting the poor young
Infant, New England, with its old Puritan mother and her affairs, which
ought to be disentangled, to be made conspicuous by the Infant herself now
she has grown big.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>These traceable threads of relation are ever of romantic interest to me,
and even when I refer to the dress of English folk I linger with pleasure
with those whose lives were connected even by the smallest thread with the
Infant, New England. One such thread of connection was in the life of Lady
Mary Armine; so I choose to give her picture <a
href="#Lady_Mary_Armine.">here</a>, to illustrate the dress, if not of a
New Englander, yet of one of New England's closest friends. She was a
noble, high-minded English gentlewoman, who gave &quot;even to her dying
day&quot; to the conversion of poor tawny heathen of New England. A
churchwoman by open profession, she was a Puritan in her sympathies, as
were many of England's best hearts and souls who never left the Church of
England. She gave in one gift &pound;500 to families of ministers who had
been driven from their pulpits in England. The Nipmuck schools at Natick
and Hassamanesit (near Grafton) were founded under her patronage. The life
of this &quot;Truly Honourable, Very Aged and Singularly Pious Lady who
dyed 1675,&quot; was written as a &quot;pattern to Ladies.&quot; Her long
prosy epitaph, after enumerating the virtues of many of the name of Mary,
concludes thus:--</p>

<br><br>
<blockquote>&quot;The Army of such Ladies so Divine<br>
This Lady said 'I'll follow, they Ar-mine.'<br>
Lady Elect! in whom there did combine<br>
So many Maries, might well say All Ar-mine.&quot;<br></blockquote>
<br><br>

<p>A pun was a Puritan's one jocularity; and he would pun even in an
epitaph.</p>

<p>It will be seen that Lady Mary Armine wears the straight collar or band,
and the black French hood which was the forerunner, then the rival, and at
last the survivor of the &quot;sugar-loaf&quot; beaver or felt hat,--a hood
with a history, which will have a chapter for the telling thereof. Lady
Mary wears a peaked widow's cap under her hood; this also is a detail of
much interest.</p>

<p>Another portrait of this date is of Mrs. Clark (see <a
href="#Mrs._William_Clark.">here</a>). This has two singular details;
namely, a thumb-ring, which was frequently owned but infrequently painted,
and a singular bracelet, which is accurately described in the verse of
Herrick, written at that date:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I saw about her spotless wrist<br>
Of blackest silk a curious twist<br>
Which circumvolving gently there<br>
Enthralled her arm as prisoner.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>I may say in passing that I have seen in portraits knots of narrow
ribbon on the wrists, both of men and women, and I am sure they had some
mourning significance, as did the knot of black on the left arm of the
queen of King James of England.</p>

<p>We have in the portrait shown as a frontispiece an excellent presentment
of the dress of the Puritan woman of refinement; the dress worn by the
wives of Winthrop, Endicott, Leverett, Dudley, Saltonstall, and other
gentlemen of Salem and Boston and Plymouth. We have also the dress worn by
her little child about a year old. This portrait is of Madam Padishal. She
was a Plymouth woman; and we know from the inventories of estates that
there were not so many richly dressed women in Plymouth as in Boston and
Salem. This dress of Madam Padishal's is certainly much richer than the
ordinary attire of Plymouth dames of that generation.</p>

<p>This portrait has been preserved in Plymouth in the family of Judge
Thomas, from whom it descended to the present owner. Madam Padishal was
young and handsome when this portrait was painted. Her black velvet gown is
shaped just like the gown of Madam Rawson (shown <a
href="#Rebecca_Rawson.">here</a>), of Madam Stoddard (shown <a
href="#Mrs._Simeon_Stoddard.">here</a>), both Boston women; and of the
English ladies of her times. It is much richer than that of Lady Mary
Armine or Mrs. Clark.</p>

<p>The gown of Madam Padishal is varied pleasingly from that of Lady Mary
Armine, in that the body is low-necked, and the lace whisk is worn over the
bare neck. The pearl necklace and ear-rings likewise show a more frivolous
spirit than that of the English dame.</p>

<p>Another Plymouth portrait of very rich dress, that of Elizabeth Paddy,
Mrs. John Wensley, faces this page. The dress in this is a golden-brown
brocade under-petticoat and satin overdress. The stiff, busked stays are
equal to Queen Elizabeth's. Revers at the edge of overdress and on the
virago sleeves are now of flame color, a Spanish pink, but were originally
scarlet, I am sure. The narrow stomacher is a beaded galloon with bright
spangles and bugles. On the hair there shows above the ears a curious
ornament which resembles a band of this galloon. There are traces of a
similar ornament in Madam Rawson's portrait (<a
href="#Rebecca_Rawson.">here</a>); and Madam Stoddard's (<a
href="#Mrs._Simeon_Stoddard.">here</a>) has some ornament over the ears.
This may have been a modification of a contemporary Dutch head-jewel. The
pattern of the lace of Elizabeth Paddy's whisk is most distinct; it was a
good costly Flemish parchment lace like Mrs. Padishal's. She carries a fan,
and wears rings, a pearl necklace, and ear-rings. I may say here that I
have never seen other jewels than these,--a few rings, and necklace and
ear-rings of pearl. Other necklaces seem never to have been worn.</p>

<p>We cannot always trust that all the jewels seen in these portraits were
real, or that the sitter owned as many as represented. A bill is in
existence where a painter charged ten shillings extra for bestowing a gold
and pearl necklace upon his complaisant subject. In this case, however, the
extra charge was to pay for the gold paint or gold-leaf used for gilding
the painted necklace. In the amusing letters of Lady Sussex to Lord Verney
are many relating to her portrait by Van Dyck. She consented to the
painting very unwillingly, saying, &quot;it is money ill bestowed.&quot;
She writes:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Put Sr Vandyke in remembrance to do my pictuer well. I
have seen sables with the clasp of them set with diamonds--if those I am
pictured in were done so, I think it would look very well in the pictuer.
If Sr Vandyke thinks it would do well I pray desier him to do all the
clawes so. I do not mene the end of the tales but only the end of the other
peces, they call them clawes I think.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>This gives a glimpse of a richness of detail in dress even beyond our
own day, and one which I commend to some New York dame of vast wealth, to
have the claws of her sables set with diamonds. She writes later in two
letters of some weeks' difference in date:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I am glad you have prefalede with Sr Vandyke to make my
pictuer leaner, for truly it was too fat. If he made it farer it will bee
to my credit. I am glad you have made Sr Vandyke mind my dress.&quot; ...
</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;I am glad you have got home my pictuer, but I doubt he
has made it lener or farer, but too rich in jewels, I am sure; but 'tis no
great matter for another age to thinke mee richer than I was. I wish it
could be mended in the face for sure 'tis very ugly. The pictuer is very
ill-favourede, makes me quite out of love with myselfe, the face is so bigg
and so fat it pleases mee not at all. It looks like one of the Windes
puffinge--(but truly I think it is lyke the
original).&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>I am struck by a likeness in workmanship in the portraits of these two
Plymouth dames, and the portrait of Madam Stoddard (<a
href="#Mrs._Simeon_Stoddard.">here</a>), and succeeding illustrations of
the Gibbes children. I do wish I knew whether these were painted by Tom
Child--a painter-stainer and limner referred to by Judge Samuel Sewall in
his Diary, who was living in Boston at that time. Perhaps we may find
something, some day, to tell us this. I feel sure these were all painted in
America, especially the portraits of the Gibbes children. A great many
coats-of-arms were made in Boston at this time, and I expect the
painter-stainer made them. All painting then was called coloring. A man
would say in 1700, &quot;Archer has set us a fine example of expense; he
has colored his house, and has even laid one room in oils; he had the
painter-stainer from Boston to do it--the man who limns faces, and does
pieces, and tricks coats.&quot; This was absolutely correct English, but we
would hardly know that the man meant: &quot;Archer has been extravagant
enough; he has painted his house, and even painted the woodwork of one
room. He had the artist from Boston to do the work--the painter of faces
and full-lengths, who makes coats-of-arms.&quot;</p>

<p>It is hard to associate the very melancholy countenance shown <a
href="#Rebecca_Rawson.">here</a> with a tradition of youth and beauty. Had
the portrait been painted after a romance of sorrow came to this young
maid, Rebecca Rawson, we could understand her expression; but it was
painted when she was young and beautiful, so beautiful that she caught the
eye and the wandering affections of a wandering gentleman, who announced
himself as the son of one nobleman and kinsman of many others, and
persuaded this daughter of Secretary Edward Rawson to marry him, which she
did in the presence of forty witnesses. This young married pair then went
to London, where the husband deserted Rebecca, who found to her horror that
she was not his wife, as he had at least one English wife living. Alone and
proud, Rebecca Rawson supported herself and her child by painting on glass;
and when at last she set out to return to her childhood's home, her life
was lost at sea by shipwreck.</p>

<p>The portrait of another Boston woman of distinction, Mrs. Simeon
Stoddard, is given <a href="#Mrs._Simeon_Stoddard.">here</a>. I will
attempt to explain who Mrs. Simeon Stoddard was. She was Mr. Stoddard's
third widow and the third widow also of Peter Sergeant, builder of the
Province House. Mr. Sergeant's second wife had been married twice before
she married him, and Simeon Stoddard's father had four wives, all having
been widows when he married them. Lastly, our Mrs. Simeon Stoddard,
triumphing over death and this gallimaufry of Boston widows, took a fourth
husband, the richest merchant in town, Samuel Shrimpton. Having had in all
four husbands of wealth, and with them and their accumulation of widows
there must have been as a widow's mite an immense increment and inheritance
of clothing (for clothing we know was a valued bequest), it is natural that
we find her very richly dressed and with a distinctly haughty look upon her
handsome face as becomes a conqueror both of men and widows.</p>

<p>The straight, lace collar, such as is worn by Madam Padishal and shown
in all portraits of this date, is, I believe, a whisk.</p>

<p>The whisk was a very interesting and to us a puzzling article of attire,
through the lack of precise description. It was at first called the
falling-whisk, and is believed to have been simply the handsome,
lace-edged, stiff, standing collar turned down over the shoulders. This
collar had been both worn with the ruff and worn after it, and had been
called a fall. Quicherat tells that the &quot;whisk&quot; came into
universal use in 1644, when very low-necked gowns were worn, and that it
was simply a kerchief or fichu to cover the neck.</p>

<p>We have a few side-lights to help us, as to the shape of the whisk, in
the form of advertisements of lost whisks. In one case (1662) it is &quot;a
cambric whisk with Flanders lace, about a quarter of a yard broad, and a
lace turning up about an inch broad, with a stock in the neck and a strap
hanging down before.&quot; And in 1664 &quot;A Tiffany Whisk with a great
Lace down and a little one up, of large Flowers, and open work; with a Roul
for the Head and Peak.&quot; The roll and peak were part of a cap.</p>

<H4>Mrs. Simeon Stoddard.</H4>
</center>
<br><br>

<p>These portraits show whisks in slightly varying forms. We have the
&quot;broad Lace lying down&quot; in the handsome band at the shoulder; the
&quot;little lace standing up&quot; was a narrow lace edging the whisk at
the throat or just above the broad lace. Sometimes the whisk was wholly of
mull or lawn. The whisk was at first wholly a part of woman's attire, then
for a time it was worn, in modified form, by men.</p>

<p>Madam Pepys had a white whisk in 1660 and then a &quot;noble lace
whisk.&quot; The same year she bought hers in London, Governor Berkeley
paid half a pound for a tiffany whisk in Virginia. Many American women,
probably all well-dressed women, had them. They are also seen on French
portraits of the day. One of Madam de Maintenon shows precisely the same
whisk as this of Madam Padishal's, tied in front with tiny knots of
ribbon.</p>

<p>It will be noted that Madam Padishal has black lace frills about the
upper portion of the sleeve, at the arm-scye. English portraits previous to
the year 1660 seldom show black lace, and portraits are not many of the
succeeding forty years which have black lace, so in this American portrait
this detail is unusual. The wearing of black lace came into a short
popularity in the year 1660, through compliment to the Spanish court upon
the marriage of the young French king, Louis XIV, with the Infanta. The
English court followed promptly. Pepys gloried in &quot;our Mistress
Stewart in black and white lace.&quot; It interests me to see how quickly
American women had the very latest court fashions and wore them even in
uncourtlike America; such distinct novelties as black lace. Contemporary
descriptions of dress are silent as to it by the year 1700, and it
disappears from portraits until a century later, when we have pretty black
lace collars, capes and fichus, as may be seen on the portraits of Mrs.
Sedgwick, Mrs. Waldo, and others later in this book. These first black
laces of 1660 are Bayeux laces, which are precisely like our Chantilly
laces of to-day. This ancient piece of black lace has been carefully
preserved in an old New York family. A portrait of the year 1690 has a
black lace frill like the Maltese laces of to-day, with the same guipure
pattern. But such laces were not made in Malta until after 1833. So it must
have been a guipure lace of the kind known in England as parchment lace.
This was made in the environs of Paris, but was seldom black, so this was a
rare bit. It was sometimes made of gold and silver thread. Parchment lace
was a favorite lace of Mary, Queen of Scots, and through her good offices
was peddled in England by French lace-makers. The black moir&eacute; hoods
of Italian women sometimes had a narrow edge of black lace, and a little
was brought to England on French hoods, but as a whole black lace was
seldom seen or known.</p>

<br><br>

<p>An evidence of the widespread extent of fashions even in that day, a
proof that English and French women and American women (when American women
there were other than the native squaws) all dressed alike, is found in
comparing portraits. An interesting one from the James Jackson Jarvis
Collection is now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. It is of an unknown
woman and by an unknown artist, and is simply labelled &quot;Of the School
of Susteman.&quot; But this unknown Frenchwoman has a dress as precisely
like Madam Padishal's and Madam Stoddard's as are Doucet's models of to-day
like each other. All have the whisk of rich straight-edged lace, and the
tiny knots of velvet ribbon. All have the sleeve knots, but the French
portrait is gay in narrow red and buff ribbon.</p>

<p>Doubtless many have formed their notion of Puritan dress from the
imaginary pictures of several popular modern artists. It can plainly be
seen by any one who examines the portraits in this book that they are
little like these modern representations. The single figures called
&quot;Priscilla&quot; and &quot;Rose Standish&quot; are well known. The
former is the better in costume, and could the close dark cloth or velvet
hood with turned-back band, and plain linen edge displayed beneath, be
exchanged for the horseshoe shaped French hood which was then and many
years later the universal head-wear, the verisimilitude would be increased.
This hood is shown on the portraits of Madam Rawson, Madam Stoddard,
Mistress Paddy, and others in this book. Rose Standish's cap is a very
pretty one, much prettier than the French hood, but I do not find it like
any cap in English portraits of that day. Nor have I seen her picturesque
sash. I do not deny the existence in portraits of 1620 of this cap and
sash; I simply say that I have never found them myself in the hundreds of
English portraits, effigies, etc., that I have examined.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the women in the modern pictures all wear aprons.
I think this is correct as they are drawn in their everyday dress, but it
will be noted that none of these portraits display an apron; nor was an
apron part of any rich dress in the seventeenth century. The reign of the
apron had been in the sixteenth century, and it came in again with Anne. Of
course every woman in Massachusetts used aprons.</p>

<p>Early inventories of the effects of emigrant dames contain many an item
of those housewifely garments. Jane Humphreys, of Dorchester,
Massachusetts, had in her good wardrobe, in 1668, &quot;2 Blew aprons, A
White Holland Apron with a Small Lace at the bottom. A White Holland Apron
with two breathes in it. My best white apron. My greene apron.&quot;</p>

<p>In the pictures, <i>The Return of the Mayflower</i> and <I>The Pilgrim
Exiles</I>, the masculine dress therein displayed is very close to that of
the real men of the times. The great power of these pictures is, after all,
not in the dress, but in the expression of the faces. The artist has
portrayed the very spirit of pure religious feeling, self-denial,
home-longing, and sadness of exile which we know must have been imprinted
on those faces.</p>

<p>The lack of likeness in the women's dress is more through difference of
figure and carriage and an indescribable cut of the garments than in
detail, except in one adjunct, the sleeve, which is wholly unlike the
seventeenth-century sleeve in these portraits. I have ever deemed the
sleeve an important part both of a man's coat and a woman's gown. The
tailor in the old play, <I>The Maid of the Mill</I>, says, &quot;O Sleeve!
O Sleeve! I'll study all night, madam, to magnify your sleeves!&quot; By
its inelegant shape a garment may be ruined. By its grace it accents the
beauty of other portions of the apparel. In these pictures of Puritan
attire, it has proved able to make or mar the likeness to the real dress.
It is now a component part of both outer and inner garment. It was formerly
extraneous.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry VIII, the sleeve was generally a separate article
of dress and the most gorgeous and richly ornamented portion of the dress.
Outer and inner sleeves were worn by both men and women, for their doublets
were sleeveless. Elizabeth gradually banished the outer hanging sleeve,
though she retained the detached sleeve.</p>

<p>Sleeves had grown gravely offensive to Puritans; the slashing was
excessive. A Massachusetts statute of 1634 specifies that &quot;No man or
woman shall make or buy any slashed clothes other than one slash in each
sleeve and another in the back. Men and women shall have liberty to wear
out such apparell as they now are provided of except the immoderate great
sleeves and slashed apparel.&quot;</p>

<p>Size and slashes were both held to be a waste of good cloth.
&quot;Immoderate great sleeves&quot; could never be the simple coat sleeve
with cuff in which our modern artists are given to depicting Virginian and
New England dames. Doubtless the general shape of the dress was simple
enough, but the sleeve was the only part which was not close and plain and
unornamented. I have found no close coat sleeves with cuffs upon any old
American portraits. I recall none on English portraits. You may see them,
though rarely, in England under hanging sleeves upon figures which have
proved valuable conservators of fashion, albeit sombre of design and rigid
of form, namely, effigies in stone or metal upon old tombs; these not after
the year 1620, though these are really a small &quot;leg-of-mutton&quot;
sleeve being gathered into the arm-scye. A beautiful brass in a church on
the Isle of Wight is dated 1615. This has long, hanging sleeves edged with
leaflike points of cut-work; cuffs of similar work turn back from the
wrists of the undersleeves. A <I>Satyr</I> by Fitzgeffrey, published the
same year, complains that the wrists of women and men are clogged with
bush-points, ribbons, or rebato-twists. &quot;Double cufts&quot; is an
entry in a Plymouth inventory--which explains itself. In the hundreds of
inventories I have investigated I have never seen half a dozen entries of
cuffs. The two or three I have found have been specified as &quot;lace
cuffs.&quot;</p>

<p>George Fox, the founder of Quakerism, wrote with a vivid pen; one of his
own followers said with severity, &quot;He paints high.&quot; Some of his
denunciations of the dress of his day afford a very good notion of the
peculiarities of contemporary costume; though he may be read with this
caution in mind. He writes deploringly of women's sleeves (in the year
1654); it will be noted that he refers to double cuffs:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The women having their cuffs double under and above, like
a butcher with his white sleeves, their ribands tied about their hands, and
three or four gold laces about their clothes.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>There were three generations of English heralds named Holme, all
genealogists, and all artists; they have added much to our knowledge of old
English dress. Randle Holme, the Chester herald, lived in the reign of
Charles II, and increased a collection of manuscript begun by his
grandfather and now forming part of the Harleian Collection in the British
Museum. He wrote also the <i>Academy of Armoury</i>, published in 1688, and
made a vast number of drawings for it, as well as for his other works. His
note-books of drawings are preserved. In one of them he gives drawings of
the sleeve which is found on every seventeenth-century portrait of American
women which I have ever seen. He calls this a virago-sleeve. It was worn in
Queen Elizabeth's day, but was a French fashion. It is gathered very full
in the shoulder and again at the wrist, or at the forearm. At intervals
between, it is drawn in by gathering-strings of narrow ribbons, or ferret,
which are tied in a pretty knot or rose on the upper part of the sleeve.
One from a French portrait is given <a href="#Virago-sleeve.">here</a>.
Madam Ninon de l'Enclos also wears one. This gathering may be at the elbow,
forming thus two puffs, or there may be several such drawing-strings. I
have seen a virago-sleeve with five puffs. It is a fine decorative sleeve,
not always shapely, perhaps, but affording in the pretty knots of ribbon
some relief to the severity of the rest of the dress.</p>

<p>Stubbes wrote, &quot;Some have sleeves cut up the arm, drawn out with
sundry colours, pointed with silk ribbands, and very gallantly tied with
love knotts.&quot; It was at first a convention of fashion, and it lingered
long in some modification, that wherever there was a slash there was a knot
of ribbon or a bunch of tags or aglets. This in its origin was really that
the slash might be tied together. Ribbon knots were much worn; the early
days of the great court of Louis XIV saw an infinite use of ribbons for men
and women. When, in the closing years of the century, rows of these knots
were placed on either side of the stiff busk with bars of ribbon forming a
stomacher, they were called <i>echelles</i>, ladders. <i>The Ladies'
Dictionary</i> (1694) says they were &quot;much in request.&quot;</p>

<p>This virago-sleeve was worn by women of all ages and by children, both
boys and girls. A virago-sleeve is worn by Rebecca Rawson (<a
href="#Rebecca_Rawson.">here</a>), and by Mrs. Simeon Stoddard (<a
href="#Mrs._Simeon_Stoddard.">here</a>), by Madam Padishal and by her
little girl, and by the Gibbes child shown later in the book.</p>

<p>A carved figure of Anne Stotevill (1631) is in Westminster Abbey. Her
dress is a rich gown slightly open in front at the foot. It has ornamental
hooks, or frogs, with a button at each end--these are in groups of three,
from chin to toe. Four groups of three frogs each, on both sides, make
twenty-four, thus giving forty-eight buttons. A stiff ruff is at the neck,
and similar smaller ones at the wrist. She wears a French hood with a loose
scarf over it. She has a very graceful virago-sleeve with handsome knots of
ribbon.</p>

<p>It is certain that men's sleeves and women's sleeves kept ever close
company. Neither followed the other; they walked abreast. If a woman's
sleeves were broad and scalloped, so was the man's. If the man had a tight
and narrow sleeve, so did his wife. When women had virago-sleeves, so did
men. Even in the nineteenth century, at the first coming of leg-of-mutton
sleeves in 1830 <i>et seq</i>., dandies' sleeves were gathered full at the
armhole. In the second reign of these vast sleeves a few years ago, man had
emancipated himself from the reign of woman's fashions, and his sleeves
remained severely plain.</p>

<p>Small invoices of fashionable clothing were constantly being sent across
seas. There were sent to and from England and other countries
&quot;ventures,&quot; which were either small lots of goods sent on
speculation to be sold in the New World, or a small sum given by a private
individual as a &quot;venture,&quot; with instructions to purchase abroad
anything of interest or value that was salable. To take charge of these
petty commercial transactions, there existed an officer, now obsolete,
known as a supercargo. It is told that one Providence ship went out with
the ventures of one hundred and fifty neighbors on board--that is, one
hundred and fifty persons had some money or property at stake on the trip.
Three hundred ventures were placed with another supercargo. Sometimes women
sent sage from their gardens, or ginseng if they could get it. A bunch of
sage paid in China for a porcelain tea-set. Along the coast, women ventured
food-supplies,--cheese, eggs, butter, dried apples, pickles, even hard
gingerbread; another sent a barrel of cider vinegar. Clothes in small lots
were constantly being bought and sold on a venture. From London, in
November, 1667, Walter Banesely sent as a venture to William Pitkin in
Hartford these articles of clothing with their prices:--</p>

<p>In the year 1640 a collection of twenty-six pictures of Englishwomen was
issued by one Wenceslas Hollar, an engraver and drawing-master, with this
title, <i>Ornatus Muliebris Anglicanus. The severall Habits of
Englishwomen, from the Nobilitie to the Country Woman As they are in these
Times.</i> These bear the same relation to portraits showing what was
really worn, as do fashion-plates to photographs. They give us the shapes
of gowns, bonnets, etc., yet are not precisely the real thing. The value of
this special set is found in three points: First, the drawings confirm the
testimony of Lely, Van Dyck, and other artists; they prove how slightly Van
Dyck idealized the costume of his sitters. Second, they give
representations of folk in the lower walks of life; such folk were not of
course depicted in portraits. Third, the drawings are full length, which
the portraits are not. Four of these drawings are reduced and shown <a
href="#Costumes_of_Englishwomen_of_the_Seventeenth_Century.">here</a>. I
give <a href="#A_Puritan_Dame.">here</a> the one entitled <i>The Puritan
Woman</i>, though it is one of the most disappointing in the whole
collection. It is such a negative presentation; so little marked detail or
even associated evidence is gained from it. I had a baffled thought after
examining it that I knew less of Puritan dress than without it. I see that
they gather up their gowns for walking after a mode known in later years as
washerwoman style. And by that very gathering up we lose what the drawing
might have told us; namely, how the gowns were shaped in the back; how
attached to the waist or bodice; and how the bodice was shaped at the
waist, whether it had a straight belt, whether it was pointed, whether
slashed in tabs or laps like a samare. The sleeve, too, is concealed, and
the kerchief hides everything else. We know these kerchiefs were worn among
the &quot;fifty other ways,&quot; for some portraits have them; but the
whisk was far more common. Lady Catharina Howard, aged eleven in the year
1646, was drawn by Hollar in a kerchief.</p>

<p>There had been some change in the names of women's attire in twenty
years, since 1600, when the catalogue of the Queen's wardrobe was made.
Exclusive of the Coronation, Garter, Parliament, and mourning robes, it ran
thus:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Robes.<br>
Petticoats.<br>
French gowns. <br>
Cloaks.<br>
Round gowns. <br>
Safeguards.<br>
Loose gowns.<br>
Jupes.<br>
Kirtles.<br>
Doublets.<br>
Foreparts.<br>
Lap mantles.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>In her New Year's gifts were also, &quot;strayt-bodyed gowns,
trayn-gowns, waist-robes, night rayls, shoulder cloaks, inner sleeves,
round kirtles.&quot; She also had nightgowns and jackets, and underwear,
hose, and various forms of foot-gear. Many of these garments never came to
America. Some came under new names. Many quickly disappeared from
wardrobes. I never read in early American inventories of robes, either
French robes or plain robes. Round gowns, loose gowns, petticoats, cloaks,
safeguards, lap mantles, sleeves, nightgowns, nightrails, and night-jackets
continued in wear.</p>

<p>I have never found the word forepart in this distinctive signification
nor the word kirtle; though our modern writers of historical novels are
most liberal of kirtles to their heroines. It is a pretty, quaint name, and
ought to have lingered with us; but &quot;what a deformed thief this
Fashion is&quot;--it will not leave with us garment or name that we like
simply because it pleases us.</p>

<p>Doublets were worn by women.</p>

<blockquote> &quot;The Women also have doublets and Jerkins as men have,
buttoned up the brest, and made with Wings, Welts and Pinions on shoulder
points as men's apparell is for all the world, &amp; though this be a kind
of attire appropriate only to Man yet they blush not to wear
it.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Anne Hibbins, the <i>witch</i>, had a black satin doublet among other
substantial attire.</p>

<p>A fellow-barrister of Governor John Winthrop, Sergeant Erasmus Earle, a
most uxorious husband, was writing love-letters to his wife Frances, who
lived out of London, at the same time that Winthrop was writing to Margaret
Winthrop. Earle was much concerned over a certain doublet he had ordered
for his wife. He had bought the blue bayes for this garment in two pieces,
and he could not decide whether the shorter piece should go into the sleeve
or the body, whether it should have skirts or not. If it did not, then he
had bought too much silver lace, which troubled him sorely.</p>

<p>Margaret Winthrop had better instincts; to her husband's query as to
sending trimming for her doublet and gown, she answers, &quot;<i>When I see
the cloth</i> I will send word what trimming will serve;&quot; and she
writes to London, insisting on &quot;the civilest fashion now in use,&quot;
and for Sister Downing, who is still in England, to give Tailor Smith
directions &quot;that he may make it the better.&quot; Mr. Smith sent
scissors and a hundred needles and the like homely gifts across seas as
&quot;tokens&quot; to various members of the Winthrop household, showing
his friendly intimacy with them all. For many years after America was
settled we find no evidence that women's garments were ever made by
mantua-makers. All the bills which exist are from tailors. One of William
Sweatland for work done for Jonathan Corwin of Salem is in the library of
the American Antiquarian Society:--</p>

<p>From many bills and inventories we learn that the time of the settlement
of Plymouth and Boston reached a transitional period in women's dress as it
did in men's. Mrs. Winthrop had doublets as had Governor Winthrop, but I
think her daughter wore gowns when her sons wore coats. The doublet for a
woman was shaped like that of a man, and was of double thickness like a
man's. It might be sleeveless, with a row of welts or wings around the
armhole; or if it had sleeves the welts, or a roll or cap, still remained.
The trimming of the arm-scye was universal, both for men and women. A
fuller description of the doublet than has ever before been written will be
given in the chapter upon the Evolution of the Coat. The &quot;somar&quot;
which is the samare, named also in the bill of the Salem tailor, seems to
have been a Dutch garment, and was so much worn in New York that I prefer
to write of it in the following chapter. We are then left with the gown;
the gown which took definite shape in Elizabeth's day. Of course no one
could describe it like Stubbes. I frankly confess my inability to approach
him. Read his words, so concise yet full of color and conveying detail; I
protest it is wonderful.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Their Gowns be no less famous, some of silk velvet
grogram taffety fine cloth of forty shillings a yard. But if the whole gown
be not silke or velvet then the same shall be layed with lace two or three
fingers broade all over the gowne or the most parte. Or if not so (as Lace
is not fine enough sometimes) then it must be garded with great gardes of
costly Lace, and as these gowns be of sundry colours so they be of divers
fashions changing with the Moon. Some with sleeves hanging down to their
skirts, trayling on the ground, and cast over the shoulders like a cow's
tayle. These have sleeves much shorter, cut up the arme, and pointed with
Silke-ribons very gallantly tyed with true loves knottes--(for soe they
call them). Some have capes fastened down to the middist of their backs,
faced with velvet or else with some fine wrought silk Taffeetie at the
least, and fringed about Bravely, and (to sum up all in a word) some are
pleated and ryveled down the back wonderfully with more knacks than I can
declare.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>The guards of lace a finger broad laid on over the seams of the gown are
described by Pepys in his day. He had some of these guards of gold lace
taken from the seams of one of his wife's old gowns to overlay the seams of
one of his own cassocks and rig it up for wear, just as he took his wife's
old muff, like a thrifty husband, and bought her a new muff, like a kind
one. Not such a domestic frugalist was he, though, as his contemporary, the
great political economist, Dudley North, Baron Guildford, Lord Sheriff of
London, who loved to sit with his wife ripping off the old guards of lace
from her gown, &quot;unpicking&quot; her gown, he called it, and was not at
all secret about it. Both men walked abroad to survey the gems and guards
worn by their neighbors' wives, and to bring home word of new stuffs, new
trimmings, to their own wives. Really a seventeenth-century husband was not
so bad. Note in my <i>Life of Margaret Winthrop</i> how Winthrop's
fellow-barrister, Sergeant Erasmus Earle, bought camlet and lace, and
patterns for doublets for his wife Frances Fontayne, and ran from London
clothier to London mantua-maker, and then to London haberdasher and London
tailor, to learn the newest weaves of cloth, the newest drawing in of the
sleeves. I know no nineteenth-century husband of that name who would hunt
materials and sleeve patterns, and buy doublet laces and find gown-guards
for his wife. And then the gown sleeves! What a description by Stubbes of
the virago-sleeve &quot;tied in and knotted with silk ribbons in
love-knots!&quot; It is all wonderful to read.</p>

<p>We learn from these tailors' bills that tailors' work embraced far more
articles than to-day; in the <i>Orbis Sensualium Pictus</i>, 1659, a
tailor's shop has hanging upon the wall woollen hats, breeches, waistcoats,
jackets, women's cloaks, and petticoats. There are also either long hose or
lasts for stretching hose, for they made stockings, leggins, gaiters,
buskins; also a number of boxes which look like muff-boxes. One tailor at
work is seated upon a platform raised about a foot from the floor. His seat
is a curious bench with two legs about two feet long and two about one foot
long. The base of the two long legs are on the floor, the other two set
upon the platform. The tailor's feet are on the platform, thus his work is
held well up before his face. Sometimes his legs are crossed upon the
platform in front of him. The platform was necessary, or, at any rate,
advisable for another reason. The habits of Englishmen at that time, their
manners and customs, I mean, were not tidy; and floors were very dirty. Any
garment resting on the floor would have been too soiled for a gentleman's
wear before it was donned at all.</p>

<p>I have discovered one thing about old-time tailors,--they were just as
trying as their successors, and had as many tricks of trade. A writer in
1582 says, &quot;If a tailor makes your gown too little, he covers his
fault with a broad stomacher; if too great, with a number of pleats; if too
short, with a fine guard; if too long with a false gathering.&quot;</p>

<p>In several of the household accounts of colonial dames which I have
examined I have found the prices and items very confusing and irregular
when compared with tailors' bills and descriptive notes and letters
accompanying them. And in one case I was fain to believe that the lady's
account-book had been kept upon the plan devised by the simple Mrs.
Pepys,--a plan which did anger her spouse Samuel &quot;most mightily.&quot;
He was filled with admiration of her household-lists--her kitchen accounts.
He admired in the modern sense of the word &quot;admire&quot;; then he
admired in the old-time meaning--of suspicious wonder. For albeit she could
do through his strenuous teaching but simple sums in
&quot;Arithmetique,&quot; had never even attempted long division, yet she
always rendered to her husband perfectly balanced accounts, month after
month. At last, to his angry queries, she whimpered that &quot;whenever she
doe misse a sum of money, she do add some sums to other things,&quot; till
she made it perfectly correct in her book--a piece of such simple duplicity
that I wonder her husband had not suspected it months before. And she also
revealed to him that she &quot;would lay aside money for a necklace&quot;
by pretending to pay more for household supplies than she really had, and
then tying up the extra amount in a stocking foot. He writes, &quot;I find
she is very cunning and when she makes least show hath her wits at work;
and <i>so</i> to my office to my accounts.&quot;</p>

is a matter of deep regret that no &quot;Lists of Apparel&quot; were made
out for the women emigrants in any of the colonies. Doubtless many came who
had a distinct allotment of clothing, among them the redemptioners. We know
one case, that of the &quot;Casket Girls,&quot; of Louisiana, where a group
of &quot;virtuous, modest, well-carriaged young maids&quot; each had a
casket or box of clothing supplied to her as part of her payment for
emigration. I wish we had these lists, not that I should deem them of great
value or accuracy in one respect since they would have been made out
naturally by men, but because I should like to read the struggles of the
average shipping-clerk or supercargo, or even shipping-master or company's
president, over the items of women's dress. One reason why the lists we
have in the court records are so wildly spelled and often vague is, I am
sure, because the recording-clerks were always men. Such hopeless puzzles
as droll or drowlas, cale or caul or kail, chatto or shadow, shabbaroon or
chaperone, have come to us through these poor struggling gentlemen.</p>

<p>There are not to my knowledge any portraits in existence of the wives of
the first Dutch settlers of New Netherland. They would have been dressed, I
am sure, in the full dress of Holland vrouws. We can turn to the court
records of New Netherland to learn the exact item of the dress of the
settlers. Let me give in full this inventory of an exceptionally rich and
varied wardrobe of Madam Jacob de Lange of New Amsterdam, 1662:--</p>

<p>This is a most interesting list of garments. The sleeves with great lace
must from their price have been very rich articles of dress. The yellow
lace drowlas, since there were four of them (and no other neckerchiefs,
such as gorgets, piccadillies, or whisks are named), must have been
neckwear of some form. I suspect they are the lace drowls or drolls to
which I refer in a succeeding chapter on A Vain Puritan Grandmother. The
rain cloth cap of black silk is curious also, being intended to wear over
another cap or a love-hood. The cornet caps with lace are a Dutch fashion.
The &quot;lace&quot; was in the form of lappets or pinners which flapped
down at the side of the face over the ears and almost over the cheeks.
Evelyn speaks of a woman in &quot;a cornet with the upper pinner dangling
about her cheeks like hound's ears.&quot; Cotgrave tells in rather vague
definition that a cornet is &quot;a fashion of Shadow or Boone Grace used
in old time and to this day by old women.&quot; It was not like a bongrace,
nor like the cap I always have termed a shadow, but it had two points like
broad horns or ears with lace or gauze spread over both and hanging from
these horns. Cornets and corneted caps are often in Dutch inventories in
early New York. And they can be seen in old Dutch pictures. They were one
of the few distinctly Dutch modes that lingered in New Netherland; but by
the third generation from the settlement they had disappeared.</p>

<p>What the words &quot;potto-foo&quot; and &quot;potoso-a-samare&quot;
mean I cannot decipher. I have tried to find Dutch words allied in sound
but in vain. I believe the samare was a Dutch fashion. We rarely find
samares worn in Virginia and Maryland, but the name frequently occurs in
the first Dutch inventories in New Netherland and occasionally in the
Connecticut valley, where there were a few Dutch settlers; occasionally
also in Plymouth, whose first settlers had been for a number of years under
Dutch influences in Holland; and rarely in Salem and Boston, whose planters
also had felt Dutch influences through the settling in Essex and Suffolk of
opulent Flemish and Dutch &quot;clothiers&quot;--cloth-workers. These
Dutchmen had married Englishwomen, and their presence in English homes was
distinctly shown by the use then and to the present day of Dutch words,
Dutch articles of dress, furniture, and food. From these Dutch-settled
shires of Essex and Suffolk came John Winthrop and all the so-called Bay
Emigration.</p>

<p>I am convinced that a samare was a certain garment which I have seen in
French, Dutch, and English portraits of the day. It is a tight-fitting
jacket or waist or bodice--call it what you will; its skirt or portion
below the belt-line is four to eight inches deep, cut up in tabs or oblong
flaps, four on each side. These slits are to the belt line. It is, to
explain further, a basque, tight-fitting or with the waist laid in plaits,
and with the basque skirt cut in eight tabs. These laps or tabs set out
rather stiffly and squarely over the full-gathered petticoats of the
day.</p>

<p>I turn to a Dutch dictionary for a definition of the word
&quot;samare,&quot; though my Dutch dictionary being of the date 1735 is
too recent a publication to be of much value. In it a samare is defined
simply as a woman's gown. Randle Holme says, rather vaguely, that it is a
short jacket for women's wear with four side-laps, reaching to the knees.
In this rich wardrobe of the widow De Lange, twelve petticoats are
enumerated and no overdress-jacket or doublet of any kind except those
samares. Their price shows that they were not a small garment. One
&quot;silk potoso-a-samare with lace&quot; was worth &pound;3. One
&quot;tartanel samare with tucker&quot; was worth &pound;1 10s. One
&quot;black silk crape samare with tucker&quot; was worth &pound;1 10s.,
and three &quot;flowered calico&quot; samares were worth &pound;2 10s. They
were evidently of varying weights for summer and winter wear, and were worn
over the rich petticoat.</p>

<p>The bill of the Salem tailor, William Sweatland (1679), shows that he
charged 9s. for making a scarlet petticoat with silver lace; for making a
black broadcloth gown 18s.; while &quot;new-makeing a plush somar for
Mistress.&quot; (which was making over) was 6s.; &quot;making a somar for
your Maide&quot; was 10s., which was the same price he charged for making a
gown for the maid.</p>

<p>The colors in the Dutch gowns were uniformly gay. Madam Cornelia de Vos
in a green cloth petticoat, a red and blue &quot;Haarlamer&quot; waistcoat,
a pair of red and yellow sleeves, a white cornet cap, green stockings with
crimson clocks, and a purple &quot;Pooyse&quot; apron was a blooming
flower-bed of color.</p>

<p>I fear we have unconsciously formed our mental pictures of our Dutch
forefathers through the vivid descriptions of Washington Irving. We
certainly cannot improve upon his account of the Dutch housewife of New
Amsterdam:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Their hair, untortured by the abominations of art, was
scrupulously pomatumed back from their foreheads with a candle, and
covered with a little cap of quilted calico, which fitted exactly to their
heads. Their petticoats of linsey-woolsey were striped with a variety of
gorgeous dyes, though I must confess those gallant garments were rather
short, scarce reaching below the knee; but then they made up in the
number, which generally equalled that of the gentlemen's small-clothes;
and what is still more praise-worthy, they were all of their own
manufacture,--of which circumstance, as may well be supposed, they were
not a little vain.<br> <br>

&quot;Those were the honest days, in which
every woman stayed at home, read the Bible, and wore pockets,--ay, and
that, too, of a goodly size, fashioned with patchwork into many curious
devices, and ostentatiously worn on the outside. These, in fact, were
convenient receptacles where all good housewives carefully stored away
such things as they wished to have at hand; by which means they often
came to be incredibly crammed.<br> <br> &quot;Besides these notable
pockets, they likewise wore scissors and pincushions suspended from their
girdles by red ribbons, or, among the more opulent and showy classes, by
brass and even silver chains, indubitable tokens of thrifty housewives and
industrious spinsters. I cannot say much in vindication of the shortness
of the petticoats; it doubtless was introduced for the purpose of giving
the stockings a chance to be seen, which were generally of blue worsted,
with magnificent red clocks; or perhaps to display a well-turned ankle and
a neat though serviceable foot, set off by a high-heeled leathern shoe,
with a large and splendid silver buckle.<br> <br> &quot;There was a secret
charm in those petticoats, which no doubt entered into the consideration
of the prudent gallants. The wardrobe of a lady was in those days her only
fortune; and she who had a good stock of petticoats and stockings was as
absolutely an heiress as is a Kamtschatka damsel with a store of
bear-skins, or a Lapland belle with plenty of
reindeer.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>A Boston lady, Madam Knights, visiting New York in 1704, wrote also with

<p>The jewels of one settler of New Amsterdam were unusually rich (in
1650), and were enumerated thus:--</p>

<table>
<tr><td></td><td align=right> &pound;</td><td align=right> s.</td><td align=right>d.</td></tr>
<tr><td> One embroidered purse with silver bugle and chain to the girdle and silver hook and eye</td><td align=right>1</td><td align=right>4</td></tr>
<tr><td> One pair black pendants, gold nocks</td><td align=right></td><td align=right>10</td></tr>
<tr><td> One gold boat, wherein thirteen diamonds &amp; one white coral chain</td><td align=right> 16</td></tr>

<tr><td> Two diamond rings</td><td align=right> 24</td></tr>
<tr><td> One gold ring with clasp beck</td><td align=right></td><td align=right>12</td></tr>
<tr><td> One gold ring or hoop bound round with diamonds</td><td align=right>2</td><td align=right> 10</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These jewels were owned by the wife of an English-born citizen; but some
of the Dutch dames had handsome jewels, especially rich chatelaines with
their equipages and etuis with rich and useful articles in variety. When we
read of such articles, we find it difficult to credit the words of an
English clergyman who visited Albany about the year 1700; namely, that he
found the Dutch women of best Albany families going about their homes in
summer time and doing their household work while barefooted.</p>

<p>Many conditions existed in Maryland which were found nowhere else in the
colonies. These were chiefly topographical. The bay and its many and
accommodative tide-water estuaries gave the planters the means, not only of
easy, cheap, and speedy communication with each other, but with the whole
world. It was a freedom of intercourse not given to any other
<i>agricultural</i> community in the whole world. It was said that every
planter had salt water within a rifle-shot of his front gate--therefore the
world was open to him. The tide is never strong enough on this shore to
hinder a sailboat nor is the current of the rivers perceptible. The crop of
the settlers was wholly tobacco--indeed, all the processes of government,
of society, of domestic life, began and ended with tobacco. It was a
wonderfully lucrative crop, but it was an unhappy one for any colony; for
the tobacco ships arrived in fleets only in May and June, when the crops
were ready for market. The ships could come in anywhere by tide-water.
Hence there were two or three months of intense excitement, or jollity,
lavishness, extravagance, when these ships were in; a regular Bartholomew
Fair of disorder, coarse wit, and rough fun; and the rest of the year there
was nothing; no business, no money, no fun. Often the planter found himself
after a month of June gambling and fun with three years' crops pledged in
advance to his creditors. The factor then played his part; took a mortgage,
perhaps, on both crops and plantation; and invariably ended in owning
everything. A striking but coarse picture of the traffic and its evils is
given in <i>The Sot-weed Factor</i>, a poem of the day.</p>

<p>Land and living were cheap in this tobacco land, but labor was needed
for the sudden crops; so negro slaves were bought, and warm invitations
were sent back to England for all and every kind of labor. Convicts were
welcomed, redemptioners were eagerly sought for; and the scrupulous laws
which were made for their protection were blazoned in England. Many
laborers were &quot;crimped,&quot; too, in England, and brought of course,
willy-nilly, to Maryland. Landlords were even granted lands in proportion
to their number of servants; a hundred acres per capita was the allowance.
It can readily be seen that an ambitious or unscrupulous planter would
gather in in some way as many heads as possible.</p>

<p>Maryland under the Baltimores was the only colony that then admitted
convicts--that is, admitted them openly and legally. She even greeted them
warmly, eager for the labor of their hands, which was often skilled labor;
welcomed them for their wits, albeit these had often been ill applied;
welcomed them for their manners, often amply refined; welcomed them for
their possibilities of rehabilitation of morals and behavior.</p>

<p>The kidnapped servants did not fare badly. Many examples are known where
they worked on until they had acquired ample means; still the literature of
the day is full of complaints such as this in <i>The Sot-weed
Factor</i>:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Not then a slave; for twice two years<br>
My clothes were fashionably new.<br>
Nor were my shifts of linen blue.<br>
But Things are Changed. Now at the Hoe<br>
I daily work; and Barefoot go.<br>
In weeding Corn, or feeding Swine<br>
I spend my melancholy time.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Cheap ballads were sold in England warning English maidens against
kidnapping.</p>

<p>In the collection of Old Black Letter Ballads in the British Museum is
one entitled <i>The Trappan'd Maiden or the Distressed Damsel</i>. Its date
is believed to be 1670.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The Girl was cunningly trappan'd<br>
Sent to Virginny from England.<br>
Where she doth Hardship undergo;<br>
There is no cure, it must be so;<br>
But if she lives to cross the Main<br>
She vows she'll ne'er go there again.<br>
&nbsp; Give ear unto a Maid<br>
&nbsp; That lately was betray'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sent unto Virginny O.<br>
&nbsp; In brief I shall declare<br>
&nbsp; What I have suffered there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When that I was weary, O.<br>
&nbsp; The cloathes that I brought in<br>
&nbsp; They are worn so thin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Land of Virginny O.<br>
&nbsp; Which makes me for to say<br>
&nbsp; Alas! and well-a-day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When that I was weary, O.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>The indentured servant, the redemptioner, or free-willer saw before him,
at the close of his seven years term, a home in a teeming land; he would
own fifty acres of that land with three barrels, an axe, a gun, and a
hoe--truly, the world was his. He would have also a suit of kersey, strong
hose, a shirt, French fall shoes, and a good hat,--a Monmouth cap,--a suit
worthy any man. Abigail had an equal start, a petticoat and waistcoat of
strong wool, a perpetuana or callimaneo, two blue aprons, two linen caps, a
pair of new shoes, two pairs of new stockings and a smock, and three
barrels of Indian corn.</p>

<p>We find that many of these redemptioners became soldiers in the colonial
wars, often distinguished for bravery. This was through a law passed by the
British government that all who enlisted in military service in the
colonies were released by that act from further bondage.</p>

<p>In the year 1659, on an autumn day, two white men with an Indian guide
paddled swiftly over the waters of Chesapeake Bay on business of much
import. They had come from Manhattan, and bore despatches from Governor
Stuyvesant to the governor of Maryland, relating to the ever troublesome
query of those days, namely, the exact placing of boundary lines. One of
these men was Augustine Herrman, a man of parts, who had been ambassador to
Rhode Island, a ship-owner, and man of executive ability, which was proven
by his offer to Lord Baltimore to draw a map of Maryland and the
surrounding country in exchange for a tract of land at the head of the bay.
He was a land-surveyor, and drew an excellent map; and he received the four
thousand acres afterwards known as Bohemia Manor. His portrait and that of
his wife exist; they are wretched daubs, as were many of the portraits of
the day, but, nevertheless, her dress is plainly revealed by it. You can
see a copy of it <a href="#Lady_Herrman.">here</a>. The overdress, pleated
body, and upper sleeve are green. The little lace collar is drawn up with a
tiny ribbon just as we see collars to-day. Her hair is simplicity itself.
The full undersleeves and heavy ear-rings give a little richness to the
dress, which is not English nor is it Dutch.</p>

<p>It is easy to know the items of the dress of the early Virginian
settlers, where any court records exist. Many, of course, have perished in
the terrible devastations of two long wars; but wherever they have escaped
destruction all the records of church and town in the various counties of
Virginia have been carefully transcribed and certified, and are open to
consultation in the Virginia State Library at Richmond, where many of the
originals are also preserved. Many have also been printed. Mr. Bruce, in
his fine book, <i>The Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth
Century</i>, has given frequent extracts from these certified records. From
them and from the originals I gain much knowledge of the dress of the
planters at that time. It varied little from dress in the New England
colonies save that Virginians were richer than New Englanders, and so had
more costly apparel. Almost nothing was manufactured in Virginia. The
plainest and simplest articles of dress, save those of homespun stuffs,
were ordered from England, as well as richer garments. We see even in
George Washington's day, until he was prevented by war, that he sent
frequent orders, wherein elaborately detailed attire was ordered with the
pettiest articles for household and plantation use.</p>

<p>Mrs. Francis Pritchard of Lancaster, Virginia (in 1660), we find had a
representative wardrobe. She owned an olive-colored silk petticoat, another
of silk tabby, and one of flowered tabby, one of velvet, and one of white
striped dimity. Her printed calico gown was lined with blue silk, thus
proving how much calico was valued. Other bodices were a striped dimity
jacket and a black silk waistcoat. To wear with these were a pair of
scarlet sleeves and other sleeves of ruffled holland. Five aprons, various
neckwear of Flanders lace, and several rich handkerchiefs completed a gay
costume to which green silk stockings gave an additional touch of color.
Green was distinctly the favorite color for hose among all the early
settlers; and nearly all the inventories in Virginia have that entry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sarah Willoughby of Lower Norfolk, Virginia, had at the same date a
like gay wardrobe, valued, however, at but &pound;14. Petticoats of calico,
striped linen, India silk, worsted prunella, and red, blue, and black silk
were accompanied with scarlet waistcoats with silver lace, a white knit
waistcoat, a &quot;pair of red paragon bodices,&quot; and another pair of
sky-colored satin bodices. She had also a striped stuff jacket, a worsted
prunella mantle, and a black silk gown. There were distinctions in the
shape of the outer garments--mantles, jackets, and gowns. Hoods, aprons,
and bands completed her comfortable attire.</p>

<p>Though so much of the clothing of the Virginia planters was made in
England, there was certain work done by home tailors; such work as repairs,
alterations, making children's common clothing, and the like, also the
clothing of upper servants. Often the tailor himself was a bond-servant.
Thus, Luke Mathews, a tailor from Hereford, England, was bound to Thomas
Landon for a term of two years from the day he landed. He was to have
sixpence a day while working for the Landon family, but when working for
other persons half of whatever he earned. In the Lancaster County records
is a tailor's account (one Noah Rogers) from the year 1690 to 1709; it was
paid, of course, in tobacco. We may set the tobacco as worth about twopence
a pound. It will be thus seen from the following items that prices in
Virginia were higher than in New England:--</p>

<p>The extraordinary prices of one hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco for
making a pair of stockings, and one hundred for a pair of gloves, when
making a coat was but forty, must remain a seventeenth-century puzzle. This
coat was probably a petticoat. It is curious, too, to find a tailor making
gloves and stockings at any price. I think both buff gloves and stockings
were of leather. Perhaps he charged thus broadly because it was &quot;not
in his line.&quot; Work in leather was always well paid. We find tailors
making leather breeches and leather drawers; the latter could not be the
garments thus named to-day. Tailors became prosperous and well-to-do,
perhaps because they worked in winter when other Virginia tradesfolk were
idle; and they acquired large tracts of land.</p>

<p>The conditions of settlement of Virginia were somewhat different from
those of the planting of New England. We find the land of many
Massachusetts towns wholly taken up by a group of settlers who emigrated
together from the Old World and gathered into a town together in the New.
It was like the transferal of a neighborhood. It brought about many happy
results of mutual helpfulness and interdependence. From it arose that
system of domestic service in which the children of friends rendered
helpful duty in other households and were called help. Nothing of the kind
existed in Virginia. There was far less neighborhood life. Plantations were
isolated. Lines of demarcation in domestic service were much more definite
where black life slaves and white bond-servants for a term of years
performed all household service. For the daughter of one Virginia household
to &quot;help&quot; in the work in another household was unknown. Each
system had its benefits; each had its drawbacks. Neither has wholly
survived; but something better has been evolved, in spite of our
lamentations for the good old times.</p>

<p>Life is better ordered, but it is not so picturesque as when negro
servants swarmed in the kitchen, and German, Scotch, and Irish
redemptioners served in varied callings. There was vast variety of attire
to be found on the Virginia and Maryland plantations and in the few towns
of these colonies. The black slaves wore homespun cloths and homespun
stuff, crocus and Virginia cloth; and the women were happy if they could
crown their simple attire with gay turbans. Indians stalked up to the
plantation doors, halted in silence, and added their gay dress of the wild
woods. German sectaries and mystics fared on garbed in their simple peasant
dress. Irish sturdy beggars idled and fiddled through existence, in dress
of shabby gentility, with always a wig. &quot;Wild-Irish&quot; came in
brogues and Irish trousers. Sailors and pirates came ashore gayly dressed
in varied costume, with gay sashes full of pistols and cutlasses,
swaggering from wharf to plantation. Queer details of dress had all these
varied souls; some have lingered to puzzle us.</p>

<p>A year ago I had sent to me, by a descendant of an old Virginia family,
a photograph of a curious gold medal or disk, a family relic which was
evidently a token of some importance, since it bore tiny holes and had
marks of having been affixed as an insignia. Though I could decipher the
bold initials, cut in openwork, I could judge little by the colorless
photograph, and finally with due misgivings and great precautions in
careful packing, insurance, etc., the priceless family relic was intrusted
to an express company for transmission to my inspection. Glad indeed was I
that the owner had not presented it in person; for the decoration of honor,
the insignia of rank, the trophy of prowess in war or emblem of conquest in
love, was the pauper's badge of a Maryland or Virginia parish. It was not a
pleasant task to write back the mortifying news; but I am proud of the
letter which I composed; no one could have done the deed better.</p>

<p>There was an old law in Virginia which ran thus:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Every person who shall receive relief from the parish and
be sent to the said alms-house, shall, upon the shoulder of the right
sleeve of his uppermost garment in an open and visible manner, wear a
badge with the name of the parish to which he or she belongs, cut in red,
blue or green cloth, as the vestry or church wardens shall direct. And if
any poor person shall neglect or refuse to wear such badge, such offense
may be punished either by ordering his or her allowance to be abridged,
suspended or withdrawn, or the offender to be whipped not exceeding five
lashes for one offense; and if any person not entitled to relief as
aforesaid, shall presume to wear such badge, he or she shall be whipped for
every such offense.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>This law did not mean the full name of the parish, but significant
initials. Sometimes the initials &quot;P P&quot; were employed, standing
for public pauper. In other counties a metal badge was ordered, often cast
in pewter. In one case a die-cutter was made by which an oblong brass badge
could be cut, and stamps of letters to stamp the badges accompanied it.
Sometimes these badges were three inches long.</p>

<p>The expression, &quot;the badge of poverty,&quot; became a literal one
when all persons receiving parochial relief had to wear a large Roman
&quot;P&quot; with the initial of their parish set on the right sleeve of
the uppermost garment in an open and visible manner. Likewise all
pensioners were ordered to wear their badges &quot;so they may be
seen.&quot; A pauper who refused to do this might be whipped and imprisoned
for twenty-one days. Moreover, if the parish beadle neglected to spy out
that the badge was missing from some poor pensioner, he had to pay half a
crown himself. This legality was necessitated by actions like that of the
English goody, who, when ordered to wear this pauper's badge, demurely
fastened it to her flannel petticoat. For this law, like all the early
Virginia statutes, was simply a transcript of English laws. In New York,
for some years in the eighteenth century, the parish poor--there were no
paupers--were ordered to wear these badges.</p>

<p>This mode of stigmatizing offenders as well as paupers was in force in
the earlier days of all the colonies. Its existence in New England has been
immortalized in <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>. I have given in my book,
<i>Curious Punishments of By-gone Days</i>, many examples of the wearing of
significant letters by criminals in various New England towns, in Plymouth,
Salem, Taunton, Boston, Hartford, New London, also in New York. It offered
a singular and striking detail of costume to see William Bacon in Boston,
and Robert Coles in Roxbury, wearing &quot;hanged about their necks on
their outerd garment a D made of Ridd cloth sett on white.&quot; A Boston
woman wore a great &quot;B,&quot; not for Boston, but for blasphemy. John
Davis wore a &quot;V&quot; for viciousness. Others were forced to wear for
years a heavy cord around the neck, signifying that the offender lived
under the shadow of the gallows and its rope.</p>

<p>But return we to the metal badge which has caused this diversion to so
gloomy a subject as crime and punishment. It was simply an oblong plate
about three and one-half inches long, of humble metal--pinchbeck, or
alchemy--but plated heavily with gold, therefore readily mistaken for solid
gold; upon it the telltale initials &quot;P P&quot; had been stamped with a
die, while smaller letters read &quot;St. J. Psh.&quot; These confirmed my
immediate suspicions, for I had seen an order of relief for a stricken
wanderer--an order for two weeks' relief, where the wardens of &quot;St. J.
Psh.&quot; ordered the sheriff to send the pauper on--to make him
&quot;move along&quot; to some other parish. This gold badge was not unlike
the metal badges worn on the left arm by &quot;Bedlam beggars,&quot; the
licensed beggars of Bethlehem Hospital, the half-cured patients of that
asylum for lunatics.</p>

<p>The owner of this badge with ancient letters had not idly accepted them,
or jumped at the conclusion that it was a decoration of honor for his
ancestor. He had searched its history long, and he had found in Hall's
<i>Chronicles of the Pageants and Progress of the English Kings</i> ample
reference to similar letters, but not as pauper's badges. Indeed, like many
another well-read and intelligent person, he had never heard of pauper's
badges. He read:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;In this garden was the King and five with him apparyelled
in garments of purpull satyn, every edge garnished with frysed golde and
every garment full of posyes made of letters of fine gold, of bullion as
thick as might be. And six Ladyes wore rochettes rouled with crymosyn
velvet and set with lettres like Carettes. And after the Kyng and his
compaignions had daunsed, he appointed the Ladies, Gentlewomen, and
Ambassadours to take the lettres off their garments in token of
liberalyte. Which thing the common people perceiving, ranne to them and
stripped them. And at this banket a shypman of London caught certayn
lettres which he sould to a goldsmith for &pound;3. 14s.
8d.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>All this was pleasing to the vanity of our friend, who fancied his
letters as having taken part in a like pageant; perhaps as a gift of the
king himself. We must remember that he believed his badge of pure gold. He
did not know it was a base metal, plated. He proudly pictured his forbears
taking part in some kingly pageant. He scorned so modern and commonplace a
possibility as a society like Knights of the Golden Horseshoe, which was
formed of Virginian gentlefolk.</p>

<p>It plainly was a relic of some romance, and in the strangely picturesque
events of the early years in this New World need not, though a pauper's
badge, have been a badge of dishonor. What strange event or happening, or
scene had it overlooked? Why had it been covered with its golden sheet? Was
it in defiance or in satire, in remorse, or in revenge, or in humble and
grateful recognition of some strange and protecting Providence? We shall
never know. It was certainly not an agreeable discovery, to think that your
great-grandmother or grandfather had probably been branded as a public
pauper; but there were strange exiles and strange paupers in those days,
exiles through political parties, through the disfavor of kings, through
religious conviction, and the pauper of the golden badge, the pauper of
&quot;St. J. Psh.,&quot; may have ended his days as vestryman of that very
church. Certain it was, that no ordinary pauper would have, or could have,
thus preserved it; and from similar reverses and glorifying equally base
objects came the subjects of half the crests of English heraldry.</p>

<H4>Pocahontas.</H4>
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The likeness of Pocahontas (<a href="#Pocahontas.">here</a>) is dated
1616. It is in the dress of a well-to-do Englishwoman, a woman of
importance and means. This portrait has been a shock to many who idealized
the Indian princess as &quot;that sweet American girl&quot; as Thackeray
called her. Especially is it disagreeable in many of the common prints from
it. One flippant young friend, the wife of an army officer, who had been
stationed in the far West, said of it, in disgust, remembering her frontier
residence, &quot;With a man's hat on! just like every old Indian
squaw!&quot; This hat is certainly displeasing, but it was not worn through
Indian taste; it was an English fashion, seen on women of wealth as well as
of the plainer sort. I have a score of prints and photographs of English
portraits, wherein this mannish hat is shown. In the original of this
portrait of Pocahontas, the heavy, sombre effect is much lightened by the
gold hatband. These rich hatbands were one of the articles of dress
prohibited as vain and extravagant by the Massachusetts magistrates. They
were costly luxuries. We find them named and valued in many inventories in
all the colonies, and John Pory, secretary of the Virginia colony, wrote
about that time to a friend in England a sentence which has given, I think
to all who read it, an exaggerated notion of the dress of Virginians:--</p>

<blockquote> &quot;Our cowekeeper here of James citty on Sundays goes
accoutred all in ffreshe fflaminge silke, and a wife of one that had in
England professed the blacke arte not of a Scholler but of a Collier
weares her rough beaver hatt with a faire perle hatband, and a silken sute
there to correspond.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Corroborative evidence of the richness and great cost of these hatbands
is found in a letter of Susan Moseley to Governor Yardley of Virginia,
telling of the exchange of a hatband and jewel for four young cows, one
older cow and four oxen, on account of her &quot;great want of
cattle.&quot; She writes on &quot;this Last July 1650, at Elizabeth River
in Virginia&quot;:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I had rayther your wife should weare them then any gentle
woman I yet know in ye country; but good Sir have <i>no</i> scruple
concerninge their rightnesse, for I went my selfe from Rotterdam to ye
haugh (The Hague) to inquire of ye gould smiths and found y't they weare
all Right, therefore thats without question, and for ye hat band y't alone
coste five hundred gilders as my husband knows verry well and will tell
you soe when he sees you; for ye Juell and ye ringe they weare made for me
at Rotterdam and I paid in good rex dollars sixty gilders for ye Juell and
fivety and two gilders for ye ringe, which comes to in English monny
eleaven poundes fower shillings. I have sent the sute and Ringe by your
servant, and I wish Mrs. Yeardley health and prosperity to weare them in,
and give you both thanks for your kind token. When my husband comes home
we will see to gett ye Cattell home, in ye meantime I present my Love and
service to your selfe &amp; wife, and commit you all to God, and
remaine,<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Your friend and servant,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SUSAN
MOSELEY.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>The purchasing value of five hundred guilders, the cost of the hatband,
would be equal to-day to nearly a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>In the portrait of Pocahontas in the original, there is also much
liveliness of color, a rich scarlet with heavy braidings; these all lessen
somewhat the forbidding presence of the stiff hat. She carries a fan of
ostrich feathers, such as are depicted in portraits of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>These feather fans had little looking-glasses of silvered glass or
polished steel set at the base of the feathers. Euphues says, &quot;The
glasses you carry in fans of feathers show you to be lighter than feathers;
the new-found glass chains that you wear about your necks, argue you to be
more brittle than glass.&quot;</p>

<p>These fans were, in the queen's hands, as large as hand fire-screens;
many were given to her as New Year's gifts or other tokens, one by Sir
Francis Drake. This makes me believe that they were a fashion taken from
the North American Indians and eagerly adopted in England; where, for two
centuries, everything related to the red-men of the New World was seized
upon with avidity--except their costume.</p>

<p>The hat worn by Pocahontas, or a lower crowned form of it, is seen in
the Hollar drawing of Puritan women (<a
href="#Costumes_of_Englishwomen_of_the_Seventeenth_Century.">here</a>),
where it seems specially ugly and ineffective, and on the Quaker
Tub-preacher. It lingered for many years, perched on top of French hoods,
close caps, kerchiefs, and other variety of head-gear worn by women of all
ranks; never elegant, never becoming. I can think of no reason for its long
existence and dominance save its costliness. It was not imitated, so it
kept its place as long as the supply of beaver was ample. This hat was also
durable. A good beaver hat was not for a year nor even for a generation. It
lasted easily half a century. But we all know that the beaver disappeared
suddenly from our forests; and as a sequence the beaver hat was no longer
available for common wear. It still held its place as a splendid,
feather-trimmed, rich article of dress, a hat for dress wear, and it was
then comely and becoming. Within a few years, through national and state
protection, the beaver, most interesting of wild creatures, has increased
and multiplied in North America until it has become in certain localities a
serious pest to lumbermen. We must revive the fashion of real beaver
hats--that will speedily exterminate the race.</p>

<p>It always has seemed strange to me that, in the prodigious interest felt
in England for the American Indian, an interest shown in the thronging,
gaping sight-seers that surrounded every taciturn red-man who visited the
Old World, no fashions of ornament or dress were copied as gay, novel, or
becoming. The Indian afforded startling detail to interest the most jaded
fashion-seeker. The <i>Works of Captain John Smith</i>, Strachey's
<i>Historie of Travaile into Virginia</i>, the works of Roger Williams, of
John Josselyn, the letters of various missionaries, give full accounts of
their brilliant attire; and many of these works were illustrated. The
beautiful mantles of the Virginia squaws, made of carefully dressed skins,
were tastefully fringed and embroidered with tiny white beads and minute
disks of copper, like spangles, which, with the buff of the dressed skin,
made a charming color-study--copper and buff--picked out with white.
Sometimes small brilliant shells or feathers were added to the fringes. An
Indian princess, writes one chronicler, wore a fair white deerskin with a
frontal of white coral and pendants of &quot;great but imperfect-colored
and worse-drilled pearls&quot;--our modern baroque pearls. A chain of
linked copper encircled her neck; and her maid brought to her a mantle
called a &quot;puttawas&quot; of glossy blue feathers sewed so thickly and
evenly that it seemed like heavy purple satin.</p>

<p>A traveller wrote thus of an Indian squaw and brave:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;His wife was very well favored, of medium stature and
very bashful. She had on her back a long cloak of leather, with the fur
side next to her body. About her forehead she had a band of white coral.
In her ears she had bracelets of pearls hanging down to her waist. The
rest of her women of the better sort had pendants of copper hanging in
either ear, and some of the children of the King's brother and other
noblemen, had five or six in either ear. He himself had upon his head a
broad plate of gold or copper, for being unpolished we knew not which
metal it might be, neither would he by any means suffer us to take it off
his head. His apparel was like his wife's, only the women wear their hair
long on both sides of the head, and the men on but one side. They are of
color yellowish, and their hair black for the most part, and yet we saw
children who had very fine auburn and chestnut colored
hair.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>John Josselyn wrote of tawny beauties:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;They are girt about the middle with a Zone wrought with
Blue and White Beads into Pretty Works. Of these Beads they have
Bracelets for the Neck and Arms, and Links to hang in their Ears, and a
Fair Table curiously made up with Beads Likewise to wear before their
Breast. Their Hair they combe backward, and tye it up short with a Border
about two Handsfull broad, wrought in works as the Other with their
Beads.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Powhatan's &quot;Habit&quot; still exists. It is in England, in the
Tradescant Collection which formed the nucleus of the Ashmolean Collection.
It was probably presented by Captain John Smith himself. It is made of two
deerskins ornamented with &quot;roanoke&quot; shell-work, about seven feet
long by five feet wide. Roanoke is akin to wampum, but this is made of West
Indian shells. The figures are circles, a crude human figure and two
mythical composite animals. He also wore fine mantles of raccoon skins. A
conjurer's dress was simply a girdle with a single deerskin, while a great
blackbird with outstretched wings was fastened to one ear--a striking
ornament. I am always delighted to read such proof as this of a fact that I
have ever known, namely, that the American Indian is the most accomplished,
the most telling <i>poseur</i> the world has ever known. The ear of the
Indian man and woman was pierced along the entire outer edge and filled
with long drops, a fringe of coral, gold, and pearl. The wives of Powhatan
wore triple strings of great pearls close around their throats, and a long
string over one shoulder, while their mantles were draped to show their
full handsome neck and arms. Altogether, with their carefully dressed hair,
they would have made in full dress a fine show in a modern opera-box, and,
indeed, the Indian squaws did cause vast exhibition of curiosity and
delight when they visited London and were taken sight-seeing and
sight-seen.</p>

<p>As early as 1629 an Indian chief with his wife and son came from Nova
Scotia to England. Lord Poulet paid them much attention in Somersetshire,
and Lady Poulet took Lady Squaw up to London and gave her a necklace and a
diamond, which I suppose she wore with her blue and white beads.</p>

<p>Be the story of the saving of John Smith by Pocahontas a myth or the
truth, it forever lives a beautiful and tender reality in the hearts of
American children. Pocahontas was not the only Indian squaw who played a
kindly part in the first colonization of this country. There were many,
though their deeds and names are forgotten; and there was one Indian woman
whose influence was much greater and more prolonged than was that of
Pocahontas, and was haloed with many years of exciting adventure as well as
romance. Let me recount a few details of her life, that you may wonder with
me that the only trace of Indian life marked indelibly on England was found
on the swinging signs of inns known by the name of &quot;The Bell
Savage,&quot; &quot;La Belle Sauvage,&quot; and even &quot;The Savage and
Bell.&quot;</p>

<p>This second Indian squaw was a South Carolina neighbor of our beloved
Pocahontas; she had not, alas, the lovely disposition and noble character
of Powhatan's daughter. She was systematically and constitutionally
mischievous, like a rogue elephant, so I call her a rogue squaw. Her name
was Coosaponakasee. The name is too long and too hard to say with
frequency, so we will do as did her English friends and foes--call her
Mary. Indeed, she was baptized Mary, for she was a half-breed, and her
white father had her reared like a Christian, had her educated like an
English girl as far as could be done in the little primitive settlement of
Ponpon, South Carolina. It will be shown that the attempt was not
over-successful.</p>

<p>She was a princess, the niece of crafty old Brim, the king of two
powerful tribes of Georgia Indians, the Creeks and Uchees. In 1715, when
she was about fifteen years old, a fierce Indian war broke out in the early
spring, and at the defeat of the Indians she promptly left her school and
her church and went out into the wilds, a savage among savages, preferring
defeat and a wild summer in the woods with her own people to decorous
victory within doors with her fellow Christians.</p>

<p>The following year an Englishman, Colonel John Musgrove, accompanied by
his son, went out as a mediator to the Creek Indians to secure their
friendship, or at any rate their neutrality. The young squaw, Mary, served
as interpreter, and the younger English pacificator promptly proved his
amicable disposition by falling in love with her. He did what was more
unusual, he married her; and soon they set up a large trading-house on the
Savannah River, where they prospered beyond belief. On the arrival of the
shipload of emigrants sent out by the Trustees of Georgia the English found
Mary Musgrove and her husband already carrying on a large trade, in
securing and transacting which she had served as interpreter. When
Oglethorpe landed, he at once went to her, and asked permission to settle
near her trading-station. She welcomed him, helped him, interpreted for
him, and kept things in general running smoothly in the settlement between
the English and the Indians. The two became close friends, and as long as
generous but confiding Oglethorpe remained, all went well in the
settlement; but in time he returned to England, giving her a handsome
diamond ring in token of his esteem. Her husband died soon after and she
removed to a new station called Mount Venture. Oglethorpe shortly wrote of
her:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I find that there is the utmost endeavour by the
Spaniards to destroy her because she is of consequence and in the King's
interests; therefor it is the business of the King's friends to support
her; besides which I shall always be desirous to serve her out of the
friendship she has shown me as well as the colony.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>In a letter of John Wesley's written to Lady Oglethorpe, and now
preserved in the Georgia Historical Society, he refers frequently to Mary
Musgrove, saying:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I had with me an interpreter the half-breed, Mary
Musgrove, and daily had meetings for instruction and prayer. One woman
was baptized. She was of them who came out of great tribulation, her
husband and all her three children having been drowned four days before in
crossing the Ogeechee River. Her happiness in the gospel caused me to feel
that, like Job, the widow's heart had been caused to sing for joy. She was
married again the day following her baptism. I suggested longer days of
mourning. She replied that her first husband was surely dead; and that his
successor was of much substance, owning a cornfield and gun. I doubt the
interpreter Mary Musgrove, that she is yet in the valley and shadow of
darkness.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>One can picture the excitement of the Choctaw squaw to lose her husband
and children, and to get another husband and religion in a week's time. Her
reply that her husband &quot;was surely dead&quot; bears a close
resemblance to the hackneyed story of the response to a charivari query of
the Dutch bridegroom who had been a widower but a week, &quot;Ain't my vife
as deadt as she ever vill be?&quot;</p>

<p>Her usefulness continued. If a &quot;talk&quot; were had with the
Indians in Savannah, Fredonia, or any other settlement, Mary had to be sent
for; if Indian warriors had to be hired, to keep an army against the
Spanish or marauding Indians, Mary obtained them from her own people. If
land were bought of the Indians, Mary made the trade. She soon married
Captain Matthews, who had been sent out with a small English troop to
protect her trading-post; he also speedily died, leaving her free, after
alliances with trade and war, to find a third husband in ecclesiastical
circles, in the person of one Chaplain Bosomworth, a parson of much
pomposity and ambition, and of liberal education without a liberal brain.
He had had a goodly grant of lands to prompt and encourage him in his
missionary endeavors; and he was under the direction and protection of the
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. His mission was to convert the
Indians, and he began by marrying one; he then proceeded to break the law
by bringing in the first load of negro slaves in that colony, a trade which
was positively prohibited by the conditions and laws of the colony. When
his illegal traffic was stopped, he got his wife to send in back claims to
the colony of Georgia for $25,000 as interpreter, mediator, agent, etc.,
for the English. She had already been paid about a thousand dollars. This
demand being promptly refused, the hitherto pacific and friendly Mary,
edged on by that sorry specimen of a parson, her husband, began a series of
annoying and extraordinary capers. She declared herself empress of Georgia,
and after sending her half-brother, a full-blooded Indian, as an
advance-courier, she came with a body of Indians to Savannah. The Rev.
Thomas Bosomworth, decked in full canonical robes, headed the Indians by
the side of his empress wife, dressed in Indian costume; and an imposing
procession they made, with plenty of theatrical color. At first the
desperate colonists thought of seizing Mary and shipping her off to England
to Oglethorpe, but this notion was abandoned. As the English soldiers were
very few at that special time, and the Indian warriors many, we can well
believe that the colonists were well scared, the more so that when the
Indians were asked the reason of their visit, &quot;their answers were very
trifling and very dark.&quot; So a feast was offered them, but Mary and her
brother refused to come and to eat; and the dinner was scarcely under way
when more armed Indians appeared from all quarters in the streets, running
up and down in an uproar, and the town was in great confusion. The alarm
drums were beaten, and it was reported that the Indians had cut off the
head of the president as they sat together at the feast. Every man in the
colony turned out in full arms for duty, the women and children gathered in
groups in their homes in unspeakable terror. Then the president and his
assistants who had been at the dinner, and who had gone unarmed to show
their friendly intent, did what they should have done in the beginning,
seized that disreputable specimen of an English missionary, the Rev. Mr.
Bosomworth, and put him in prison; and we wonder they kept their hands off
him as long as they did. Still trying to settle the matter without
bloodshed, the president asked the Indian chiefs to adjourn to his house
&quot;to drink a glass of wine and talk the matter over.&quot; Into this
conference came Mary, bereft of her husband, raging like a madwoman,
threatening the lives of the magistrates, swearing she would annihilate the
colony. &quot;A fig for your general,&quot; screamed she, &quot;you own not
a foot of land in this colony. The whole earth is mine.&quot; Whereupon the
Empress of Georgia, too, was placed under military guard.</p>

<p>Then a harassing week of apprehension ensued; the Indians were fed, and
parleyed with, and reasoned with, and explained to. At last Mary's brother
Malatche, at a conference, presented as a final demand a paper setting
forth plainly the claims of the Indians. The sequel of this presentation is
almost comic. The paper was so evidently the production of Bosomworth, and
so wholly for his own personal benefit and not for that of the Indians, and
the astonishment of the president and his council was so great at his vast
and open assumption, that the Indians were bewildered in turn by the
strange and unexpected manner of the white men upon reading the paper; and
childishly begged to have the paper back again &quot;to give to him who
made it.&quot; A plain exposition of Bosomworth's greed and craft followed,
and all seemed amicably explained and settled, and the Creeks offered to
smoke the pipe of peace; when in came Mary, having escaped her guards, full
of rum and of rancor. The president said to her in a low voice that unless
she ceased brawling and quarrelling he would at once put her into close
confinement; she turned in a rage to her brother, and translated the
threat. He and every Indian in the room sprang to their feet, drew
tomahawks, and for a short time a complete massacre was imminent. Then the
captain of the guard, Captain Noble Jones, who had chafed under all this
explaining diplomacy, lost his much-tried patience, and like a brave and
fearless English soldier ordered the Indians to surrender arms. Though far
greater in number than the English, they yielded to his intrepidity and
wrath; and the following night and day they sneaked out of the town, as
ordered, by twos and threes.</p>

<p>For one month this fright and commotion and expense had existed; and at
last wholly alone were left the two contemptible malcontents and
instigators of it all. Mr. and Mrs. Bosomworth thereafter ate very humble
pie; he begged sorely and cried tearfully to be forgiven; and he wailed so
deeply and promised so broadly that at last the two were publicly
pardoned.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, they had their own way; for they soon went to London and
cut an infinitely fine figure there. Mary was the top of the mode, and
there Bosomworth managed to get for his wife lands and coin to the amount
of about a hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The prosperous twain returned to America in triumph, and built a curious
and large house on an island they had acquired; in it the Empress did not
long reign; at her death the Rev. Mr. Bosomworth married his
chambermaid.</p>

<p>Such is the sorry tale of the Indian squaw and the English parson, a
tale the more despicable because, though she had been reared in English
ways, baptized in the English faith, had been the friend of English men and
women, and married three English husbands; yet when fifty years old she
returned at vicious suggestion with promptitude and fierceness to violent
savage ways, to incite a massacre of her friends. And that suggestion came
not from her barbarian kin, but from an English gentleman--a Christian
priest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>A VAIN PURITAN GRANDMOTHER</h3>
<p style='text-indent: 0em'> <img src="images\initialt.png" align=left
alt="T">here was a certain family prominent in affairs in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, with members resident in England, New England,
and the Barbadoes. They were gentlefolk--and gentle folk; they were of
birth and breeding; and they were kindly, tender, affectionate to one
another. They were given to much letter-writing, and better still to much
letter-keeping. Knowing the quality of their letters, I cannot wonder at
either habit; for the prevalence of the letter-keeping was due, I am sure,
to the perfection of the writing. Their letters were ever lively in
diction, direct and lucid in description, and widely varied in interest;
therefore they were well worthy of preservation, simply for the owner's
re-reading. They have proved so for all who have brushed the dust from the
packages and deciphered the faded words. Moreover, these letters are among
the few family letters of our two centuries which convey, either to the
original reader or to his successor of to-day, anything that could, by most
generous construction or fullest imagination, be deemed equivalent to what
we now term News.</p>

<p>Of course their epistles contained many moral reflections and ample
religious allusions and aspirations; and they even transcribed to each
other, in full, long Biblical quotations with as much exactness and length
as if each deemed his correspondent a benighted heathen, with no Bible to
consult, instead of being an equally pious kinsman with a Bible in every
room of his house.</p>

<p>Their name was Hall. The heads of the family in early colonial days were
the merchants John Hall and Hugh Hall; these surnames have continued in the
family till the present time, as has the cunning of hand and wit of brain
in letter-writing, even into the seventh and eighth generation, as I can
abundantly testify from my own private correspondence. I have quoted freely
in several of my books from old family letters and business letter-books of
the Hall family. Many of these letters have been intrusted to me from the
family archives; others, especially the business letters, have found their
way, through devious paths, to our several historical societies; where they
have been lost in oblivion, hidden through churlishness, displayed in
pride, or offered in helpfulness, as suited the various humors of their
custodians. To the safe, wise, and generous guardianship of the American
Antiquarian Society fell a collection of letters of the years 1663 to 1684,
written from London by the merchant John Hall to his mother, Madam Rebekah
Symonds, who, after a fourth matrimonial venture,--successful, as were all
her marriages,--was living, in what must have seemed painful seclusion to
any Londoner, in the struggling little New England hamlet of Ipswich,
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>I wish to note as a light-giving fact in regard to these letters that
the Halls were as happy in marrying as in letter-writing, and as assiduous.
They married early; they married late. And by each marriage increased
wonderfully either the number of descendants, or of influential family
connections, who were often also business associates.</p>

<p>Madam Symonds had four excellent husbands, more than her share of good
fortune. She married Henry Byley in 1636; John Hall in 1641; William
Worcester in 1650; and Deputy Governor Symonds in 1663. She was, therefore,
in 1664, scarcely more than a bride (if one may be so termed for the fourth
time), when many costly garments were sent to her by her devoted and loving
son, John Hall; she was then about forty-eight years of age. Her husband,
Governor Symonds, was a gentle and noble old Puritan gentleman, a New
Englishman of the best type; a Christian of missionary spirit who wrote
that he &quot;could go singing to his grave&quot; if he felt sure that the
poor benighted Indians were won to Christ. His stepson, John Hall, never
failed in respectful and affectionate messages to him and sedately
appropriate gifts, such as &quot;men's knives.&quot; Governor Symonds had
two sons and six married daughters by two--or three--previous marriages. He
died in Boston in 1678.</p>

<p>A triangle of mutual helpfulness and prosperity was formed by England,
New England, and the Barbadoes in this widespread relationship of the Hall
family in matrimony, business, kin, and friendly allies. England sent to
the Barbadoes English trading-stuffs and judiciously cheap and attractive
trinkets. The islands sent to New England sugar and molasses, and also the
young children born in the islands, to be educated in Boston schools ere
they went to English universities, or were presented in the English court
and London society. There was one school in Boston established expressly
for the children of the Barbadoes planters. You may read in a later chapter
upon the dress of old-time children of some naughty grandchildren of John
Hall who were sent to this Boston school and to the care of another
oft-married grandmother. In this triangle, New England returned to the
Barbadoes non-perishable and most lucrative rum and salt codfish--codfish
for the many fast-days of the Roman Catholic Church; New England rum to
exchange with profit for slaves, coffee, and sugar. The Barbadoes and New
England sent good, solid Spanish coin to England, both for investment and
domestic purchases; and England sent to New England what is of value to us
in this book--the latest fashions.</p>

<p>When I ponder on the conditions of life in Ipswich at the time these
letters were written--the few good houses, the small amount of tilled land,
the entire lack of all the elegancies of social life; when I think upon the
proximity and ferocity of the Indian tribes and the ever present terror of
their invasion; when I picture the gloom, the dread, the oppression of the
vast, close-lying, primeval forest,--then the rich articles of dress and
elaborate explanation of the modes despatched by John Hall to his mother
would seem more than incongruous, they would be ridiculous, did I not know
what a factor dress was in public life in that day.</p>

<p>Poor Madam Symonds dreaded deeply lest The Plague be sent to her in her
fine garments from London; and her dutiful son wrote her to have no fear,
that he bought her finery himself, in safe shops, from reliable dealers,
and kept all for a month in his own home where none had been infected. But
she must have had fear of disaster and death more intimately menacing to
her home than was The Plague.</p>

<p>She had seen the career of genial Master Rowlandson, a neighbor's son,
full of naughtiness, fun, and life. While an undergraduate at Harvard
College he had written in doggerel what was termed pompously a
&quot;scandalous libell,&quot; and he had pinned it on the door of Ipswich
Meeting-house, along with the tax-collector's and road-mender's notices and
the announcement of intending marriages, and the grinning wolves' heads
brought for reward. For this prank he had been soundly whipped by the
college president on the College Green; but it did not prevent his
graduating with honor at the head of his class. He was valedictorian,
class-orator, class-poet--in fact, I may say that he had full honors. (I
have to add also that in his case honors were easy; for his class, of the
year 1652, had but one graduate, himself.) The gay, mischievous boy had
become a faithful, zealous, noble preacher to the Puritan church in the
neighboring town of Lancaster; and in one cruel night, in 1676, his home
was destroyed, the whole town made desolate, his parishioners slaughtered,
and his wife, Esther Rowlandson, carried off by the savage red-men, from
whom she was bravely rescued by my far-off grandfather, John Hoar. Read the
thrilling story of her &quot;captivation&quot; and rescue, and then think
of Madam Symonds's finery in her gilt trunk in the near-by town. For four
years the valley of the Nashua--blood-stained, fire-blackened--lay desolate
and unsettled before Madam Symonds's eyes; then settlers slowly crept in.
But for fifty years Ipswich was not deemed a safe home nor free from dread
of cruel Indians; &quot;Lovewell's War&quot; dragged on in 1726. But
mantuas and masks, whisks and drolls, were just as eagerly sought by the
governor's wife as if Esther Rowlandson's capture had been a dream.</p>

<p>There was a soured, abusive, intolerant old fellow in New England in the
year 1700, a &quot;vituperative epithetizer,&quot; ready to throw mud on
everything around him (though not working--to my knowledge--in cleaning out
any mud-holes). He was not abusive because he was a Puritan, but because
&quot;it was his nature to.&quot; He styled himself a &quot;Simple
Cobbler,&quot; and he announced himself &quot;willing to Mend his Native
Country, lamentably tattered both in the upper Leather and in the Sole,
with all the Honest Stitches he can take,&quot; but he took out his aid in
loud hammering of his lapstone and noisy protesting against all other
footwear than his own. I fancy he thought himself another Stubbes. I know
of no whole soles he set, nor any holes he mended, and his
&quot;Simple&quot; ideas are so involved in expression, in such twisted
sentences, and with such &quot;strange Ink-pot termes&quot; and so many
Latin quotations and derivatives, that I doubt if many sensible folk knew
what he meant, even in his own day. His words have none of the directness,
the force, the interest that have the writings of old Stubbes. Such words
as nugiperous, perquisquilian, ill-shapen-shotten, nudistertian, futulous,
overturcased, quaematry, surquedryes, prodromie, would seem to apply ill to
woman's attire; they really fall wide of the mark if intended as weapons,
but it was to such vain dames as the governor's wife that the Simple
Cobbler applied them. Some of the ministers of the colony, terrified by the
Indian outbreaks, gloomily held the vanity and extravagance of dames and
goodwives as responsible for them all. Others, with broader minds, could
discern that both the open and the subtle influence of good clothes was
needed in the new community. They gave an air of cheerfulness, of
substance, of stability, which is of importance in any new venture. For the
governor's wife to dress richly and in the best London modes added lustre
to the governor's office. And when the excitement had quieted and the
sullen Indian sachem and his tawny braves stalked through the little town
in their gay, barbaric trappings, they were sensible that Madam Symonds's
embroidered satin manteau was rich and costly, even if they did not know
what we know, that it was the top of the mode.</p>

<p>Governor Symonds's home in Ipswich was on the ground where the old
seminary building now stands; but the happy married pair spent much of the
time at his farm-house on Argilla Farm, on Heart-Break Hill, by
Labor-in-vain Creek, which was also in Ipswich County. This lonely farm, so
sad in name, was the only dwelling-place in that region; it was so remote
that when Indian assault was daily feared, the general court voted to
station there a guard of soldiers at public expense because the governor
was &quot;so much in the country's service.&quot; He says distinctly,
however, concerning the bargain in the purchase of Argilla Farm, that his
wife was well content with it.</p>

<p>There were also intimate personal considerations which would apparently
render so luxurious a wardrobe unnecessary and unsuitable. The age and
health of the wearer might generally be held to be sufficient reason for
indifference to such costly, delicate, and gay finery. When Madam Symonds
was fifty-eight years old, in 1674, her son wrote, &quot;Oh, Good Mother,
grieved am I to learn that Craziness creeps upon you, yet am I glad that
you have Faith to look beyond this Life.&quot; Craziness had originally no
meaning of infirmity of mind; it meant feebleness, weakness of body. Her
letters evidently informed him of failing health, but even that did not
hinder the export of London finery.</p>

<p>Governor Symonds's estate at his death was under &pound;3000, and
Argilla Farm was valued only at &pound;150; yet Madam had a
&quot;Manto&quot; which is marked distinctly in her son's own handwriting
as costing &pound;30. She had money of her own, and estates in England, of
which John Hall kept an account, and with the income of which he made these
purchases. This manteau was of flowered satin, and had silver clasps and a
rich pair of embroidered satin sleeves to wear with it; it was evidently
like a sleeveless cape. We must always remember that seventeenth-century
accounts must be multiplied by five to give twentieth-century values. Even
this valuation is inadequate. Therefore the &pound;30 paid for the manteau
would to-day be &pound;150; $800 would nearly represent the original value.
As it was sent in early autumn it was evidently a winter garment, and it
must have been furred with sable to be so costly.</p>

<p>In the early inventories of all the colonies &quot;a pair of
sleeves&quot; is a frequent item, and to my delight--when so seldom color
is given--I have more than once a pair of green sleeves.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Thy gown was of the grassy green<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy sleeves of satin hanging by,<br>
&nbsp;Which made thee be our harvest queen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet thou wouldst not love me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green sleeves was all my joy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green sleeves was my delight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green sleeves was my Heart of Gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who but Lady Green-sleeves!&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Let me recount some of &quot;My Good Son's labors of love and pride in
London shops&quot; for his vain old mother. She had written in the year
1675 for lawn whisks, but he is quick to respond that she has made a very
countrified mistake.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Lawn whisks is not now worn either by Gentil or simple,
young or old. Instead whereof I have bought a shape and ruffles, what is
now the ware of the bravest as well as the young ones. Such as goe not
with naked neckes, wear a black whisk over it. Therefore I have not only
bought a plain one you sent for, but also a Lustre one, such as are most
in fashion.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>John Hall's &quot;lustre for whisks&quot; was of course lustring, or
lutestring, a soft half-lustred pure silk fabric which was worn constantly
for two centuries. He sent his mother many yards of it for her wear.</p>

<p>We have ample proof that these black whisks were in general wear in
England. In an account-book of Sarah Fell of Swarthmoor Hall in 1673, are
these items: &quot;a black alamode whiske for Sister Rachel; a round whiske
for Susanna; a little black whiske for myself.&quot; This English Quaker
sends also a colored stuff manteo to her sister; scores of English
inventories of women's wardrobes contain precisely similar items to those
bought by Son Hall. And it is a tribute to the devotion of American women
to the rigid laws of fashion, even in that early day, to find that all
whisks, save black whisks and lustring ones, disappear at this date from
colonial inventories of effects.</p>

<p>She wrote to him for a &quot;side of plum colored leather&quot; for her
shoes. This was a matter of much concern to him, not at all because this
leather was a bit gay or extravagant, or frail wear for an elderly
grandmother, but because it was not the very latest thing in leather. He
writes anxiously:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Secondly you sent for Damson-Coloured Spanish Leather for
Womans Shoes. But there is noe Spanish Leather of that Colour; and Turkey
Leather is coloured on the grain side only, both of which are out of use
for Women's Shoes. Therefore I bought a Skin of Leather that is all the
mode for Women's Shoes. All that I fear is, that it is too thick. But my
Coz. Eppes told me yt such thin ones as are here generally used, would by
rain and snow in N. England presently be rendered of noe service and
therefore persuaded me to send this, which is stronger than ordinary. And
if the Shoemaker fit it well, may not be uneasy.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps his anxious offices and advices in regard to fans show more
curiously than other quotations, the insistent attitude of the New England
mind in regard to the latest fashions. I cannot to-day conceive why any
woman, young or old, could have been at all concerned in Ipswich in 1675 as
to which sort of fan she carried, or what was carried in London, yet good
Son John writes:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;As to the feathered fan, I should also have found it in
my heart to let it alone, because none but very grave persons (and of them
very few) use it. That now 'tis grown almost as obsolete as Russets and
more rare to be seen than a yellow Hood. But the Thing being Civil and not
very dear, Remembering that in the years 64 and 68, if I mistake not, you
had Two Fans sent, I have bought one now on purpose for you, and I hope
you will be pleased.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Evidently the screen-fan of Pocahontas's day was no longer a novelty.
His mother had had far more fans that he remembered. In 1664 two
&quot;Tortis shell fanns&quot; had gone across seas; one had cost five
shillings, the other ten shillings. The following year came a black feather
fan with silver handle, and two tortoise-shell fans; in 1666 two more
tortoise-shell fans; in 1688 another feather fan, and so on. These many
fans may have been disposed of as gifts to others, but the entire trend of
the son's letters, as well as his express directions, would show that all
these articles were for his mother's personal use. When finery was sent for
madam's daughter, it was so specified; in 1675, when the daughter became a
bride, Brother John sent her her wedding gloves, ever a gift of sentiment.
A pair of wedding gloves of that date lies now before me. They are mitts
rather than gloves, being fingerless. They are of white kid, and are
twenty-two inches long. They are very wide at the top, and have three
drawing-strings with gilt tassels; these are run in welts about two inches
apart, and were evidently drawn into puffs above the elbow when worn. A
full edging of white Swiss lace and a pretty design of dots made in gold
thread on the back of the hand, form altogether a very costly, elegant, and
decorative article of dress. I should fancy they cost several pounds. Men's
gloves were equally rich. Here are the gold-fringed gloves of Governor
Leverett worn in 1640.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Of course the only head-gear of Madam Symonds for outdoor wear was a
hood. Hats were falling in disfavor. I shall tell in a special chapter of
the dominance at this date and the importance of the French hood. Its heavy
black folds are shown in the portraits of Rebecca Rawson (<a
href="#Rebecca_Rawson.">here</a>), of Madam Simeon Stoddard (<a
href="#Mrs._Simeon_Stoddard.">here</a>), and on other heads in this book.
Such a hood probably covered Madam Symonds's head heavily and fully,
whene'er she walked abroad; certainly it did when she rode a pillion-back.
She had other fashionable hoods--all the fashionable hoods, in fact, that
were worn in England at that time; hoods of lustring, of tiffany, of
&quot;bird's-eye&quot;--precisely the same as had Madam Pepys, and one of
spotted gauze, the last a pretty vanity for summer wear. We may remember,
in fact, that Madam Symonds was a contemporary--across-seas--of Madam
Pepys, and wore the same garments; only she apparently had richer and more
varied garments than did that beautiful young woman whose husband was in
the immediate employ of the king.</p>

<p>Arthur Abbott was the agent in Boston through whom this London finery
and flummery was delivered to Madam Symonds in safety; and it is an amusing
side-light upon social life in the colony to know that in 1675 Abbott's
wife was &quot;presented before the court&quot; for wearing a silk hood
above her station, and her husband paid the fine. Knowing womankind, and
knowing the skill and cunning in needlework of women of that day, I cannot
resist building up a little imaginative story around this
&quot;presentment&quot; and fine. I believe that the pretty young woman
could not put aside the fascination of all the beautiful London hoods
consigned to her husband for the old lady at Ipswich; I suspect she tried
all the finery on, and that she copied one hood for herself so successfully
and with such telling effect that its air of high fashion at once caught
the eye and met with the reproof of the severe Boston magistrates. She was
the last woman, I believe, to be fined under the colonial sumptuary laws of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The colors of Madam Symonds's garments were seldom given, but I doubt
that they were &quot;sad-coloured&quot; or &quot;grave of colour&quot; as
we find Governor Winthrop's orders for his wife. One lustring hood was
brown; and frequently green ribbons were sent; also many yards of scarlet
and pink gauze, which seem the very essence of juvenility. Her son writes a
list of gifts to her and the members of her family from his own
people:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;A light violet-colored Petti-Coat is my wife's token to
you. The Petti-Coat was bought for my wife's mother and scarcely worn.
This my wife humbly presents to you, requesting your acceptance of it,
for your own wearing, as being Grave and suitable for a Person of
Quality.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Even a half-worn petticoat was a considerable gift; for petticoats were
both costly and of infinite needlework. Even the wealthiest folk esteemed a
gift of partly worn clothing, when materials were so rich. Letters of deep
gratitude were sent in thanks.</p>

<p>The variety of stuffs used in them was great. Some of these are wholly
obsolete; even the meaning of their names is lost. In an inventory of 1644,
of a citizen of Plymouth there was, for instance, &quot;a petticoate of
phillip &amp; cheny&quot; worth &pound;1. Much of the value of these
petticoats was in the handwork bestowed upon them; they were both
embroidered and elaborately quilted. About 1730, in the Van Cortlandt
family, a woman was paid at one time &pound;2 5s. for quilting, a large
amount for that day. Often we find items of fifteen or twenty shillings for
quilting a petticoat.</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>The handsomest petticoats were of quilted silk or satin. No pattern was
so elaborate, no amount of work so large, that it could dismay the heart or
tire the fingers of an eighteenth-century needlewoman. One yellow satin
petticoat has a lining of stout linen. These are quilted together in an
exquisite irregular design of interlacing ribbons, slender vines, and long,
narrow leaves, all stuffed with white cord. Though the general effect of
this pattern is very regular, an examination shows it is not a set design,
but must have been drawn as well as worked by the maker. Another petticoat
has a curious design made with two shades of blue silk cord sewed on in a
pattern. Another of infinite work has a design outlined in tiny rolls of
satin.</p>

<p>These petticoats had many flat trimmings; laces of silver, gold, or silk
thread were used, galloons and orrice. Tufts of fringed silk were dotted in
clusters and made into fly-fringe. Bridget Neal, writing in 1685 to her
sister, says:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I am told las is yused on petit-coats. Three fringes is
much yused, but they are not set on the petcot strait, but in waves; it
does not look well, unless all the fringes yused that fashion is the plane
twisted fring not very deep. I hear some has nine fringes sett in this
fashion.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Anxiety to please his honored mother, and desire that she should be
dressed in the top of the mode, show in every letter of John Hall:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I bought your muffs of my Coz. Jno. Rolfe who tells me
they are worth more money than I gave for them. You desired yours Modish
yet Long; but here with us they are now much shorter. These were made a
Purpose for you. As to yr Silk Flowered Manto, I hope it may please you;
Tis not the Mode to lyne you now at all; but if you like to have it soe,
any silke will serve, and may be done at yr
pleasure.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>In 1663 Pepys notes (with his customary delight at a new fashion,
mingled with fear that thereby he might be led into more expense) that
ladies at the play put on &quot;vizards which hid the whole face, and had
become a great fashion; and <i>so</i> to the Exchange to buy a Vizard for
my wife.&quot; Soon he added a French mask, which led to some unpleasant
encounters for Mrs. Pepys with dissolute courtiers on the street. The plays
in London were then so bold and so bad that we cannot wonder at the masks
of the play-goers. The masks concealed constant blushes; but wearers and
hearers did not stay away, for neither eyes nor ears were covered by the
mask. Busino tells of a woman at the theatre all in yellow and scarlet,
with two masks and three pairs of gloves, worn one pair over the other.
Suddenly out came disappointing Queen Anne with her royal command that the
plays be refined and reformed, and then masks were abandoned.</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>Masks were in those years in constant wear in the French court and
society, as a protection to the complexion when walking or riding.
Sometimes plain glass was fitted in the eye-holes. French masks had wires
which fastened behind the ears, or a mouthpiece of silver; or they had an
ingenious and simple stay in the form of two strings at the corners of the
mouth-opening of the mask. These strings ended in a silver button or glass
bead. With a bead held firmly in either corner of her mouth, the
mask-wearer could talk. These vizards are seen in old English wood-cuts,
often hanging by the side, fastened to the belt with a small cord or chain.
They brought forth the bitter denunciations of the old Puritan Stubbes. He
writes in his <i>Anatomie of Abuses</i>:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;When they vse to ride abroad, they haue visors made of
ueluet (or in my iudgment they may rather be called inuisories) wherewith
they couer all their faces, hauing holes made in them agaynst their eies,
whereout they looke. So that if a man that knew not their guise before,
shoulde chaunce to meete one of theme, he would thinke he mette a monster
or a deuill; for face he can see none, but two broad holes against their
eyes with glasses in them.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Masks were certainly worn to a considerable extent in America. As early
as 1645, masks were forbidden in Plymouth, Massachusetts, &quot;for
improper purposes.&quot; When you think of the Plymouth of that year, its
few houses and inhabitants, its desperate struggle to hold its place at all
as a community, the narrow means of its citizens, the comparatively scant
wardrobes of the wives and daughters, this restriction as to mask-wearing
seems a grim jest. They were for sale in Salem and Boston, black velvet
masks worth two shillings each; but these towns were more flourishing than
Plymouth. And New York dames had them, and the planters' wives of Virginia
and South Carolina.</p>

<p>I suppose Madam Symonds wore her mask when she mounted on a pillion
behind some strong young lad, and rode out to Argilla Farm.</p>

<p>A few years later than the dates when Madam Symonds was ordering these
fashionable articles of dress from England a rhyming catalogue of a lady's
toilet was written by John Evelyn and entitled, <i>Mundus Muliebris or a
Voyage to Mary-Land</i>; it might be a list of Madam Symonds's wardrobe.
Some of the lines run:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;One gown of rich black silk, which odd is<br>
Without one coloured embroidered boddice.<br>
Three manteaux, nor can Madam less<br>
Provision have for due undress.<br>
Of under-boddice three neat pair<br>
Embroidered, and of shoes as fair;<br>
Short under petticoats, pure fine,<br>
Some of Japan stuff, some of Chine,<br>
With knee-high galoon bottomed;<br>
Another quilted white and red,<br>
With a broad Flanders lace below.<br>
Three night gowns of rich Indian stuff;<br>
Four cushion-cloths are scarce enough.<br>
A manteau girdle, ruby buckle,<br>
And brilliant diamond ring for knuckle.<br>
Fans painted and perfumed three;<br>
Three muffs of ermine, sable, grey.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Other articles of personal and household comfort were gathered in London
shops by her dutiful son and sent to Madam Symonds. The list is full of
interest, and helps to fill out the picture of daily life. He despatched to
her cloves, nutmegs, spices, eringo roots, &quot;coronation&quot; and
stock-gilly-flower seed, &quot;colly flower seed,&quot; hearth brushes
(these came every year), silver whistles and several pomanders and
pomander-beads, bouquet-glasses (which could hardly have been the bosom
bottles which were worn later), necklaces, amber beads, many and varied
pins, needles, silk lacings, kid gloves, silver ink-boxes, sealing-wax,
gilt trunks, fancy boxes, painted desks, tape, ferret, bobbin, bone lace,
calico, gimp, many yards of ducape, lustring, persian, and other silk
stuffs--all these items of transport show the son's devoted selection of
the articles his mother wished. Gowns seem never to have been sent, but
manteaus, mantles, and &quot;ferrandine&quot; cloaks appear frequently. Of
course there are some articles which cannot be positively described to-day,
such as the &quot;shape, with ruffles&quot; and &quot;double pleated
drolls&quot; and &quot;lace drolls&quot; which appear several times on the
lists. These &quot;drolls&quot; were, I believe, the &quot;drowlas&quot; of
Madame de Lange, in New Amsterdam. &quot;Men's knives&quot; occasionally
were sent, and &quot;women's knives&quot; many times. These latter had
hafts of ivory, agate, and &quot;Ellotheropian.&quot; This Ellotheropian or
Alleteropeain or Illyteropian stone has been ever a great puzzle to me
until in another letter I chanced to find the spelling Hellotyropian; then
I knew the real word was the Heliotropium of the ancients, our blood-stone.
It was a favorite stone of the day not only for those fancy-handled knives,
but for seals, finger-rings and other forms of ornament.</p>

<p>A few books were on the list,--a Greek Lexicon ordered as a gift for a
student; a very costly Bible, bound in velvet, with silver clasps, the
expense of which was carefully detailed down to the Indian silk for the
inner-end leaves; &quot;<i>Dod on Commandments</i>--my Ant Jane said you
had a fancie for it, and I have bound it in green plush for you.&quot;
Fancy any one having a fancy for Dod on anything! and fancy Dod in green
plush covers!</p> <br>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE EVOLUTION OF COATS AND WAISTCOATS</h3>
<p style='text-indent: 0em'> <img src="images\initialb.png" align=left
alt="B">oth word and garment--coat--are of curious interest, one as a
philological study, the other as an evolution. A singular transfer of
meaning from cot or cote, a house and shelter, to the word coat, used for a
garment, is duplicated in some degree in chasuble, casule, and cassock; the
words body, and bodice; and corse or corpse, and corselet and corset. The
word coat, meaning a garment for men for covering the upper part of the
body, has been in use for centuries; but of very changeable and confusing
usage, for it also constantly meant petticoat. The garment itself was a
puzzle, for many years; most bewildering of all the attire which was worn
by the first colonists was the elusive, coatlike over-garment called in
shipping-lists, tailors' orders, household inventories, and other legal and
domestic records a doublet, a jerkin, a jacket, a cassock, a paltock, a
coat, a horseman's coat, an upper-coat, and a buff-coat. All these garments
resembled each other; all closed with a single row of buttons or points or
hooks and eyes. There was not a double-breasted coat in the
<i>Mayflower</i>, nor on any man in any of the colonies for many years;
they hadn't been invented. Let me attempt to define these several coatlike
garments.</p>

<br><br>
<center>
<a name="A_Plain_Jerkin."></a>
<img src="images\188.png" alt="A Plain Jerkin.">
<H4>A Plain Jerkin.</H4>
</center>
<br><br>

<p>In 1697 a jerkin was described by Randle Holme as &quot;a kind of jacket
or upper doublet, with four skirts or laps.&quot; These laps were made by
slits up from the hem to the belt-line, and varied in number, but four on
each side was a usual number, or there might be a slit up the back, and one
on each hip, which would afford four laps in all. Mr. Knight, in his notes
on Shakespere's use of the word, conjectures that the jerkin was generally
worn over the doublet; but one guess is as good as another, and I guess it
was not. I agree, however, with his surmise that the two garments were
constantly confounded; in truth it is not a surmise, it is a fact.
Shakespere expressed the situation when he said in <i>The Two Gentlemen of
Verona</i>, &quot;My jerkin is a doublet;&quot; and I fancy there was
slight difference in the garments, save that in the beginning the doublet
was always of two thicknesses, as its name indicates; and it was
wadded.</p>

<p>As the jerkin was often minutely slashed, it could scarcely have been
wadded; though it may have had a lining for special display through the
slashes.</p>

<p>A jerkin had no skirts in our modern sense of the word,--a piece set on
at the waist-line,--nor could it on that account be what we term a coat,
nor was it a coat, nor was it what the colonists deemed a coat.</p>

<p>The old Dutch word is <i>jurkken</i>, and it was often thus spelt, which
has led some to deem it a Dutch name and article of dress. But then it was
also spelt <i>irkin, ircken, jorken, jorgen, erkyn</i>, and
<i>ergoin</i>--which are not Dutch nor any other tongue. Indeed, under the
name <i>ergoin</i> I wonder that we recognize it or that it knew itself. A
jerkin was often of leather like a buff-coat, but not always so.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Saltonstall wears a buff-coat, with handsome sword-belt, or
trooping-belt, and rich gloves. His portrait is shown <a
href="#Sir_Richard_Saltonstall.">here</a>. As we look at his fine
countenance we think of Hawthorne's words:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;What dignitary is this crossing to greet the Governor. A
stately personage in velvet cloak--with ample beard and a gold band across
his breast. He has the authoritative port of one who has filled the
highest civic position in the first of cities. Of all men in the world, we
should least expect to meet the Lord Mayor of London--as Sir Richard
Saltonstall has been once and again--in a forest-bordered settlement in
the western wilderness.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>A fine buff-coat and a buff-coat sleeve are given in the chapter upon
Armor.</p>

<p>All the early colonial inventories of wearing-apparel contain doublets.
Richard Sawyer died in 1648 in Windsor, Connecticut; he was a plain average
&quot;Goodman Citizen.&quot; A part of his apparel was thus
inventoried:--</p>

<table>
<tr><td></td><td align=right>&pound;</td><td align=right> s.</td><td align=right>d.</td></tr>

<tr><td>1 stuffe jackett</td><td align=right></td><td align=right>2</td><td align=right>6</td></tr></table>

<p>William Kempe of &quot;Duxborrow,&quot; a settler of importance, died in
1641. His wardrobe was more varied, and ample and rich. He left two
buff-coats and leather doublets with silver buttons; cloth doublets, three
horsemen's coats, &quot;frize jerkines,&quot; three cassocks, two
cloaks.</p>

<p>Of course we turn to Stubbes to see what he can say for or against
doublets. His outcry here is against their size; and those who know the
&quot;great pease-cod-bellied doublets&quot; of Elizabeth's day will agree
with him that they look as if a man were wholly gone to &quot;gourmandice
and gluttonie.&quot;</p>

<p>Stubbes has a very good list of coats and jerkins in which he gives
incidentally an excellent description by which we may know a
mandillion:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Their coates and jerkins as they be diuers in colours so
be they diuers in fashions; for some be made with collars, some without,
some close to the body, some loose, which they call mandilians, couering
the whole body down to the thigh, like bags or sacks, that were drawne
ouer them, hiding the dimensions and lineaments of the body. Some are
buttoned down the breast, some vnder the arme, and some down the backe,
some with flaps over the brest, some without, some with great sleeves,
some with small, some with none at all, some pleated and crested behind
and curiously gathered and some not.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>An old satirical print, dated 1644, gives drawings of men of all the new
varieties of religious belief and practices which &quot;pestered
Christians&quot; at the beginning of the century. With the exception of the
Adamite, whose garb is that of Adam in the Garden of Eden, all ten wear
doublets. These vary slightly, much less than in Stubbes's list of jerkins.
One is open up the back with buttons and button-loops. Another has the
&quot;four laps on a side,&quot; showing it is a jerkin. Another is opened
on the hips; one is slit at back and hips. All save one from neck to hem
are buttoned in front with a single row of buttons, with no lapells,
collar, or cuffs, and no &quot;flaps,&quot; no ornaments or trimming. A
linen shirt-cuff and a plain band finish sleeves and neck of all save the
Arminian, who wears a small ruff. Not one of these doublets is a graceful
or an elegant garment. All are shapeless and over-plain; and have none of
the French smartness that came from the spreading coat-skirts of men's
later wear.</p>

<p>The welts or wings named in the early sumptuary laws were the pieces of
cloth set at the shoulder over the arm-hole where body and sleeves meet.
The welt was at first a sort of epaulet, but grew longer and often set out,
thus deserving its title of wings.</p>

<p>A dress of the times is thus described:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;His doublet was of a strange cut, the collar of it was up
so high and sharp as it would cut his throat. His wings according to the
fashion now were as little and diminutive as a Puritan's
ruff.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>A note to this says that &quot;wings were lateral projections, extending
from each shoulder&quot;--a good round sentence that by itself really means
nothing. Ben Jonson calls them &quot;puff-wings.&quot;</p>

<p>There is one positive rule in the shape of doublets; they were always
welted at the arm-hole. Possibly the sleeves were sometimes sewn in, but
even then there was always a cap, a welt or a hanging sleeve or some
edging. In the illustrations of the <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i> there is not a
doublet or jerkin on man, woman, or child but is thus welted. Some trimming
around the arm-hole was a law. This lasted until the coat was wholly
evolved. This had sleeves, and the shoulder-welt vanished.</p>

<p>These welts were often turreted or cut in squares. You will note this
turreted shoulder in some form on nearly all the doublets given in the
portraits displayed in this book--both on men and women. For doublets were
also worn by women. Stubbes says, &quot;Though this be a kind of attire
proper only to a man, yet they blush not to wear it.&quot; The old print of
the infamous Mrs. Turner given <a
href="#A_Woman's_Doublet._Mrs._Anne_Turner.">here</a> shows her in a
doublet.</p>

<p>Another author complains:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;If Men get up French standing collars Women will have the
French standing collar too: if Dublets with little thick skirts, so short
none are able to sit upon them, women's foreparts are thick skirted
too.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Children also had doublets and this same shoulder-cap at the arm-hole;
their little doublets were made precisely like those of their parents. Look
at the childish portrait of Lady Arabella Stuart, the portrait with the
doll. Her fat little figure is squeezed in a doublet which has turreted
welts like those worn by Anne Boleyn and by Pocahontas (shown <a
href="#Pocahontas.">here</a>). Often a button was set between each square
of the welt, and the sleeve loops or points could be tied to these buttons
and thus hold up the detached undersleeves. The portrait of Sir Richard
Saltonstall vaguely shows these buttons. Nearly all these garments-jerkins,
jackets, doublets, buff-coats, paltocks, were sleeveless, especially when
worn as the uppermost or outer garment. Holinshed tells of &quot;doublets
full of jagges and cuts and sleeves of sundry colours.&quot; These welts
were &quot;embroidered, indented, waved, furred, chisel-punched,
dagged,&quot; as well as turreted. On one sleeve the turreted welt varied,
the middle square or turret was long, the others each two inches shorter.
Thus the sleeve-welt had a &quot;crow-step&quot; shape. A charming doublet
sleeve of Elizabeth's day displayed a short hanging sleeve that was scarce
more than a hanging welt. This was edged around with crystal balls or
buttons. Other welts were scalloped, with an eyelet-hole in each scallop,
like the edge of old ladies' flannel petticoats. Othersome welts were a
round stuffed roll. This roll also had its day around the petticoat edge,
as may be seen in the petticoat of the child Henry Gibbes. This roll still
appears on Japanese kimonos.</p>

<p>We are constantly finding complaints of the unsuitably ambitious attire
of laboring folk in such sentences as this:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The plowman, in times past content in russet, must
now-a-daies have his doublett of the fashion with wide cuts; his fine
garters of Granada, to meet his Sis on Sunday. The fair one in russet
frock and mockaldo sleeves now sells a cow against Easter to buy her
silken gear.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Velvet jerkins and damask doublets were for men of dignity and estate.
Governor Winthrop had two tufted velvet jerkins.</p>

<p>Jerkins and doublets varied much in shape and detail:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;These doublets were this day short-waisted, anon,
long-bellied; by-and-by-after great-buttoned, straight-after plain-laced,
or else your buttons as strange for smallness as were before for
bigness.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>In Charles II's time at the May-pole dances still appear the old, welted
doublets. Jack may have worn Cicily's doublet, and Peg may have borrowed
Will's for all the difference that can be seen. The man's doublet did not
ever have long, hanging sleeves, however, in the seventeenth century, while
women wore such sleeves.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sleeves were very large, as in the Bowdoin portrait (<a
href="#A_Bowdoin_portrait.">here</a>). The great puffs were held out by
whalebones and rolls of cotton, and &quot;tiring-sleeves&quot; of wires, a
fashion which has obtained for women at least seven times in the history of
English costume. Gosson describes the vast sleeves of English doublets
thus;--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;This Cloth of Price all cut in ragges,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These monstrous bones that compass arms,<br>
These buttons, pinches, fringes, jagges,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With them he (the Devil) weaveth woeful harms.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>We have seen how bitterly the slashing of good cloth exercised good men.
The &quot;cutting in rags&quot; was slashing.</p>

<p>A favorite pattern of slashing is in small, narrow slits as shown in the
portrait <a href="#James_Douglas_(Earl_of_Morton).">here</a> of James
Douglas. These jerkins are of leather, and the slashes are of course
ornamental, and are also for health and comfort, as those know who wear
chamois jackets with perforated holes throughout them, or slashes if we
choose to call them so. They permit a circulation of the skin and a natural
condition. These jerkins are slashed in curious little cuts, &quot;carved
of very good intail,&quot; as was said of King Henry's jerkin, which means,
in modern English, cut in very good designs. And I presume, being of buff
leather, the slashes were simply cut, not overcast or embroidered as were
some wool stuffs.</p>

<p>The guard was literally a guard to the seam, a strip of galloon, silk,
lace, velvet, put on over the seam to protect and strengthen it.</p>

<p>The large openings or slashes were called panes. Fynes Mayson says,
&quot;Lord Mountjoy wore jerkins and round hose with laced panes of russet
cloth.&quot; The Swiss dress was painted by Coryat as doublet and hose of
panes intermingled of red and yellow, trimmed with long puffs of blue and
yellow rising up between the panes. It was necessarily a costly dress. Of
course this is the same word with the same meaning as when used in the term
a &quot;pane of glass.&quot;</p>

<p>The word &quot;pinches&quot; refers to an elaborate pleating which was
worn for years; it lingered in America till 1750, and we have revived it in
what we term &quot;accordion pleating.&quot; The seventeenth-century
pinching was usually applied to lawn or some washable stuff; and there must
have been a pinching, a goffering machine by which the pinching was done to
the washed garment by means of a heated iron.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Pinched sleeves, pinched partlets, pinched shirts, pinched wimples,
pinched ruffs, are often referred to, all washable garments. The good wife
of Bath wore a wimple which was &quot;y-pinched full seemly.&quot; Henry
VIII wore a pinched habit-shirt of finest lawn, and his fine, healthy skin
glowed pink through the folds of the lawn after his hearty exercise at
tennis and all kinds of athletic sports, for which he had thrown off his
doublet. We are taught to deem him &quot;a spot of grease and blood on
England's page.&quot; There was more muscle than fat in him; he could not
be restrained from constant, violent, dangerous exercise; this was one of
the causes of the admiration of his subjects.</p>

<p>The pinched partlet made a fine undergarment for the slashed
doublet.</p>

<p>So full, so close, were these &quot;pinchings,&quot; that one author
complained that men wearing them could not draw their bowstrings well. It
was said that the &quot;pinched partlet and puffed sleeves&quot; of a
courtier would easily make a lad a doublet and cloak.</p>

<p>In my chapter on Children's Dress I tell of the pinched shirt worn by
Governor Bradford when an infant, and give an illustration of it.</p>

<p>Aglets or tags were a pretty fashion revived for women's wear three
years ago. Under Stuart reign, these aglets were of gold or silver, and set
with precious stones such as pear-shaped pearls. For ordinary wear they
were of metal, silk, or leather. They secured from untwisting or ravelling
the points which were worn for over a century; these were ties or laces of
ribbon, or woollen yarn or leather, decorated with tags or aglets at one
end. Points were often home-woven, and were deemed a pretty gift to a
friend. They were employed instead of buttons in securing clothes, and were
used by the earliest settlers, chiefly, I think, as ornaments at the knee
or for holding up the stockings in the place of garters. They were regarded
as but foolish vanities, and were one of the articles of finery tabooed in
early sumptuary laws. In 1651 the general court of Massachusetts expressed
its &quot;utter detestation and dislike that men of meane condition,
education and calling should take upon them the garbe of gentlemen by the
wearinge of poynts at the knees.&quot; Fashion was more powerful than law;
the richly trimmed, sashlike garters quickly displaced the modest
points.</p>

<p>The Earl of Southampton, friend of Shakespere and of Virginia, as
pictured on a later page, wears a doublet with agletted points around his
belt, by which breeches and doublet are tied together. This is a striking
portrait. The face is very noble. A similar belt was the favorite wear of
Charles I.</p>

<p>Martin Frobisher, the hero of the Armada, wears a jerkin fastened down
the front with buttons and aigletted points. (See <a
href="#A_Plain_Jerkin.">here</a>.) I suppose, when the fronts of the jerkin
were thoroughly joined, each button had a point twisted or tied around it.
Frobisher's lawn ruff is a modest and becoming one. This portrait in the
original is full length. The remainder of the costume is very plain; it has
no garters, no knee-points, no ribbons, no shoe-roses. The foot-covering is
Turkish slippers precisely like the Oriental slippers which are imported
to-day.</p>

<p>The Earl of Morton (<a href="#James_Douglas_(Earl_of_Morton).">here</a>)
wore a jerkin of buff leather curiously pinked and slashed. Fulke
Greville's doublet (<a href="#Fulke_Greville_(Lord_Brooke).">here</a>) has
a singular puff around the waist, like a farthingale.<a
href="#A_Doublet.">Here</a> is shown a doublet of the commonest form; this
is worn by Edward Courtenay, Earl of Devonshire. The portrait is painted by
Sir Antonio More--the portrait of one artist by another, and a very fine
one, too.</p>

<p>Another garment, which is constantly named in lists of clothing, was the
cassock. Steevens says a cassock &quot;signifies a horseman's loose coat,
and is used in that sense by the writers of the age of Shakespere.&quot; It
was apparently a garment much like a doublet or jerkin, and the names were
used interchangeably. I think the cassock was longer than the doublet, and
without &quot;laps.&quot; The straight, long coats shown on the gentlemen
in the picture <a href="#Funeral_Procession.">here</a> were cassocks. The
name finally became applied only to the coat or gown of the clergy. In the
will of Robert Saltonstall, made in 1650, he names a &quot;Plush
Cassock,&quot; but cloth cassocks were the commonest wear.</p>

<p>There were other names for the doublet which are now difficult to place
precisely. In the reign of Henry VIII a law was passed as to men's wear of
velvet in their sleeveless cotes, jackets, and jupes. This word jupe and
its ally jupon were more frequently heard in women's lists; but jump, a
derivative, was man's wear. Randle Holme said: &quot;A jump extendeth to
the thighs; is open and buttoned before, and may have a slit half way
behind.&quot; It might be with or without sleeves--all this being likewise
true of the doublet. From this jump descended the modern jumper and the
eighteenth century jumps--what Dr. Johnson defined in one of his
delightsome struggles with the names of women's attire, &quot;Jumps: a kind
of loose or limber stays worn by sickly ladies.&quot;</p>

<p>Coats were not furnished to the Massachusetts or Plymouth planters, but
those of Piscataquay in New Hampshire had &quot;lined coats,&quot; which
were simply doublets like all the rest.</p>

<p>In 1633 we find that Governor Winthrop had several dozen scarlet coats
sent from England to &quot;the Bay.&quot; The consigner wrote, &quot;I
could not find any Bridgwater cloth but Red; so all the coats sent are red
lined with blew, and lace suitable; which red is the choise color of
all.&quot; These coats of double thickness were evidently doublets.</p>

<p>The word &quot;coat&quot; in the earliest lists must often refer to a
waistcoat. I infer this from the small cost of the garments, the small
amount of stuff it took to make them, and because they were worn with
&quot;Vper coats&quot;--upper coats. Raccoon-skin and deerskin coats were
many; these were likewise waistcoats, and the first lace coats were also
waistcoats. Robert Keayne of Boston had costly lace coats in 1640, which he
wore with doublets--these likewise were waistcoats.</p>

<p>As years go on, the use of the word becomes constant. There were
&quot;moose-coats&quot; of mooseskin. Josselyn says mooseskin made
excellent coats for martial men. Then come papous coats and pappous coats.
These I inferred--since they were used in Indian trading--were for
pappooses' wear, pappoose being the Indian word for child. But I had a
painful shock in finding in the <i>Traders' Table of Values</i> that
&quot;3 Pappous Skins equal 1 Beaver&quot;--so I must not believe that
pappoose here means Indian baby. Match-coats were originally of skins
dressed with the fur on, shaped in a coat like the hunting-shirt. The
&quot;Duffield Match-coat&quot; was made of duffels, a woollen stuff, in
the same shape. Duffels was called match-cloth. The word &quot;coat&quot;
here is not really an English word; it is matchigode, the Chippewa Indian
name for this garment.</p>

<p>We have in old-time letters and accounts occasional proof that the coat
of the Puritan fathers was not at all like the shapely coat of our day. We
have also many words to prove that the coat was a doublet which, as old
Stubbes said, could be &quot;pleated, or crested behind and curiously
gathered.&quot;</p>

<p>The tailor of the Winthrop family was one John Smith; he made garments
for them all, father, mother, children, and children's wives, and husband's
sisters, nieces, cousins, and aunts. He was a good Puritan, and seems to
have been much esteemed by Winthrop. One letter accompanying a coat runs:
&quot;Good Mr. Winthrop, I have, by Mr. Downing's direction sent you a
coat, a sad foulding colour without lace. For the fittness I am a little
vncerteyne, but if it be too bigg or too little it is esie to amend, vnder
the arme to take in or let out the lyning; the outside may be let out in
the gathering or taken in also without any prejudice.&quot; This
instruction would appear to prove not only that the coat was a doublet,
&quot;curiously gathered&quot; but that the &quot;fittness&quot; was more
than &quot;uncerteyne&quot; of the coats of the Fathers. Since even such
wildly broad directions could not &quot;prejudice&quot; the coat, we may
assume that Governor Winthrop was more easily suited as to the cut of his
apparel, than would have been Sir Walter Raleigh or Sir Philip Sidney.</p>

<p>Though Puritan influence on dress simplified much of the flippery and
finery of the days of Elizabeth and James, and the refining elegance of Van
Dyck gave additional simplicity as well as beauty to women's attire, which
it retained for many years, still there lingered throughout the seventeenth
century, ready to spring into fresh life at a breath of encouragement, many
grotesqueries of fashion in men's dress which, in the picturesque sneer of
the day, were deemed meet only for &quot;a changeable-silk-gallant.&quot;
At the restoration of the crown, courtiers seemed to love to flaunt
frivolity in the faces of the Puritans.</p>

<p>One of these trumperies came through the excessive use of ribbons, a use
which gave much charm to women's dress, but which ever gave to men's
garments a finicky look. Beribboned doublets came in the butterfly period,
between worm and chrysalis, between doublet and coat; beribboned breeches
were eagerly adopted.</p>

<p>Shown <a href="#205">here</a> is the copy of an old print, which shows
the dress of an estimable and sensible gentleman, Sir Thomas Orchard, with
ribbon-edged garments and much galloon or laces. It is far too much trimmed
to be rich or elegant. See also <i>The English Antick</i> on this page,
from a rare broadside. His tall hat is beribboned and befeathered; his face
is patched, ribbons knot his love-locks, his breeches are edged with
agletted ribbons, and &quot;on either side are two great bunches of ribbons
of several colors.&quot; Similar knots are at wrists and belt. His boots
are fringed with lace, and so wide that he &quot;straddled as he went along
singing.&quot;</p>

<p>Ribboned sleeves like those of Colonel Legge, <a
href="#Colonel_William_Legge.">here</a>, were a pretty fashion, but more
suited to women's wear than to men's.</p>

<p>George Fox, the founder of Quakerism, tells us what he thought of such
attire. He wrote satirically:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;If one have store of ribands hanging about his waist or
his knees and in his hat; of divers colours red, white black or yellow, O!
then he is a brave man. He hath ribands on his back, belly and knees, and
his hair powdered, this is the array of the world. Are not these that have
got ribands hanging about their arms, hands, back, waist, knees, hats, like
fiddlers' boys? And further if one get a pair of breeches like a coat and
hang them about with points, and tied up almost to the middle, a pair of
double cuffs on his hands, and a feather in his cap, here is a
gentleman!&quot;</blockquote>

<p>These beribboned garments were a French mode. The breeches were the
&quot;rhingraves&quot; of the French court, which were breeches made wholly
of loops of ribbons--like two ribboned petticoats. They caught the eye of
seafaring men; we know that Jack ashore loves finery. We are told of
sea-captains wearing beribboned breeches as they came into quiet little
American ports, and of one English gallant landing from a ship in sober
Boston, wearing breeches made wholly from waist to knee of overlapping
loops of gay varicolored ribbon. It is recorded that &quot;the boys did
wonder and call out thereat,&quot; and they &quot;were chided
therefor.&quot; It is easy to picture the scene: the staring boys, born in
Boston, of Puritan parents, of dignified dress, and more familiar with
fringes on the garments of savage Indians than on the breeches of English
gentlemen; we can see the soberly reproving minister or schoolmaster
looking with equal disapproval on the foppish visitor and the mannerless
boys; and the gayly dressed ship's captain, armed with self-satisfaction
and masculine vanity, swaggering along the narrow streets of the little
town. It mattered not what he wore or what he did, a seafaring man was
welcome. I wonder what the governor thought of those beribboned breeches!
Perhaps he ordered a pair from London for himself,--of sad-colored
ribbons,--offering the color as a compromise for the over-gayety of the
ribbons. Randle Holme gave in 1658 three descriptions of the first
petticoat-breeches, with drawings of each. One had the lining lower than
the breeches, and tied in about the knees; ribbons extended halfway up the
breeches, and ribbons hung out from the doublet all about the waistband.
The second had a single row of pointed ribbons hanging all around the lower
edge of the breeches; these were worn with stirrup-hose two yards wide at
the top, tied by points and eyelet-holes to the breeches. The third had
stirrup-hose tied to the breeches, and another pair of hose over them
turned down at the calf of the leg, and the ribbons edged the stirrup-hose.
His drawings of them are foolish things--not even pretty. He says ribbons
were worn first at the knees, then at the waist at the doublet edge, then
around the neck, then on the wrists and sleeves. These knee-ribbons formed
what Dryden called in 1674 &quot;a dangling knee-fringe.&quot; It is
difficult for me to think of Dryden living at that period of history. He
seems to me infinitely modern in comparison with it. Evelyn describes the
wearer of such a suit as &quot;a fine silken thing&quot;; and tells that
the ribbons were of &quot;well-chosen colours of red, orange, and blew, of
well-gummed satin, which augured a happy fancy.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1672 a suit of men's clothes was made for the beautiful Duchess of
Portsmouth to wear to a masquerade; this was with &quot;Rhingrave breeches
and cannons.&quot; The suit was of dove-colored silk brocade trimmed with
scarlet and silver lace and ribbons.</p>

<p>The ten yards of brocade for this beautiful suit cost &pound;14. The
Rhingrave breeches were trimmed with thirty-six yards of figured scarlet
ribbon and thirty-six yards of plain satin ribbon and thirty-six of scarlet
taffeta ribbon; this made one hundred and eight yards of ribbon--a great
amount--an unusable amount. I fear the tailor was not honest. There were
also as trimmings twenty-two yards of scarlet and silver vellum lace for
guards; six dozen scarlet and silver vellum buttons, smaller breast
buttons, narrow laces for the waistcoat, and silver twist for buttonholes.
The suit was lined with lutestring. There was a black beaver hat with
scarlet and silver edging, and lace embroidered scarlet stockings, a rich
belt and lace garters, and point lace ruffles for the neck, sleeves, and
knees. This suit had an interlining of scarlet camlet; and lutestring
drawers seamed with scarlet and silver lace. The total bill of &pound;59
would be represented to-day by $1400,--a goodly sum,--but it was a goodly
suit. There is a portrait of the Duchess of Richmond in a similar suit, now
at Buckingham Palace. Portraits of the Duke of Bedford, and of George I,
painted by Kneller, are almost equally beribboned. The one of the king is
given facing this page to show his ribbons and also the extraordinary
shoes, which were fashionable at this date.</p>

<p>&quot;Indians gowns,&quot; or banyans, were for a century worn in
England and America, and are of enough importance to receive a separate
chapter in this book. The graceful folds allured all men and all portrait
painters, just as the fashionable new china allured all women. The banyan
was not the only Oriental garment which had become of interest to
Englishmen. John Evelyn described in his <I>Tyrannus or the Mode</I> the
&quot;comeliness and usefulnesse&quot; of all Persian clothing; and he
noted with justifiable gratification that the new attire which had recently
been adopted by King Charles II was &quot;a comely dress after ye Persian
mode.&quot; He says modestly, &quot;I do not impute to this my discourse
the change which soone happened; but it was an identity I could not but
take notice of.&quot;</p>

<p>Rugge in his <I>Diurnal</I> describes the novel dress which was assumed
by King Charles and the whole court, due notice of a subject of so much
importance having been given to the council the previous month; and notice
of the king's determination &quot;never to change it,&quot; which he kept
like many another of his promises and resolutions.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;It is a close coat of cloth pinkt with a white taffety

<p>Pepys we have seen further explained that it was all black and white,
the black cassock being close to the body. &quot;The legs ruffled with
black ribands like a pigeon's leg, and I wish the King may keep it for it
is a fine and handsome garment.&quot; The news which came to the English
court a month later that the king of France had put all his footmen and
servants in this same dress as a livery made Pepys &quot;mightie merry, it
being an ingenious kind of affront, and yet makes me angry,&quot; which is
as curious a frame of mind as even curious Pepys could record.
Planch&eacute; doubts this act of the king of France; but in <i>The
Character of a Trimmer</i> the story is told <i>in extenso</i>--that the
&quot;vests were put on at first by the King to make Englishmen look unlike
Frenchmen; but at the first laughing at it all ran back to the dress of
French gentlemen.&quot; The king had already taken out the white linings as
&quot;'tis like a magpie;&quot; and was glad to quit it I do not doubt. Dr.
Holmes--and the rest of us--have looked askance at the word
&quot;vest&quot; as allied in usage to that unutterable contraction, pants.
But here we find that vest is a more classic name than waistcoat for this
dull garment--a garment with too little form or significance to be elegant
or interesting or attractive.</p>

<p>Though this dress was adopted by the whole court, and though it was an
age of portrait painting,--and surely no more delicate flattery to the
king's taste could be given than to have one's portrait painted in the
king's chosen vestments,--yet but one portrait remains which is stated to
display this dress. This is the portrait of Henry Bennet, Earl of
Arlington--it is shown on this page. This was painted by the king's own
painter, Sir Peter Lely. I must say that I cannot find much resemblance to
Pepys's or Rugge's description, unless the word &quot;pinked&quot; means
cut out in an all-over pattern like Italian cut-work; then this inner vest
might be of &quot;cloth pinkt with a white taffeta under the coat.&quot;
The surcoat is of black lined with white. Of course the sash is present,
but not in any way distinctive. It was a characteristic act in the Earl to
be painted in this dress, for he was a courtier of courtiers, perhaps the
most rigid follower of court rules in England. He was &quot;by nature of a
pleasant and agreeable humour,&quot; but after a diplomatic journey on the
continent he assumed an absurd formality of manner which was much ridiculed
by his contemporaries. His letters show him to be exceeding nice in his
phraseology; and he prided himself upon being the best-bred man in court.
He was a trimmer, &quot;the chief trickster of the court,&quot; a member of
the Cabal, the first <i>a</i> in the word; and he was heartily hated as
well as ridiculed. When a young man he received a cut on the nose in a
skirmish in Ireland; he never let his prowess be forgotten, but ever after
wore a black patch over the scar--it may be seen in his portrait. When his
fellow courtiers wished to gibe at him, they stuck black patches on their
noses and with long white staves strutted around the court in imitation of
his pompous manner. He is a handsome fellow, but too fat--which was not a
curse of his day as of the present.</p>

<p>Of course the king changed his dress many times after this solemn
assumption of a lifelong garment. It was a restless, uncertain, trying time
in men's dress. They had lost the doublet, and had not found the skirted
coat, and stood like the Englishman of Andrew Borde--ready to take a
covering from any nation of the earth. I wonder the coat ever
survived--that it did is proof of an inherent worth. Knowing the nature of
mankind and the modes, the surprise really is that the descendants of
Charles and all English folk are not now wearing shawls or peplums or
anything save a coat and waistcoat.</p>

<p>Some of the sturdy rich members of the governors' cabinets and the
assemblies and some of our American officers who had been in his Majesty's
army, or had served a term in the provincial militia, and had had a hot
skirmish or two with marauding Indians on the Connecticut River frontier,
and some very worthy American gentlemen who were not widely renowned either
in military or diplomatic circles and had never worn armor save in the
artist's studio,--these were all painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller and by Sir
Peter Lely, and by lesser lights in art, dressed in a steel corselet of the
artist, and wearing their own good Flanders necktie and their own full
well-buckled wig. There were some brave soldiers, too, who were thus
painted, but there were far more in armor than had ever smelt smoke of
powder. It was a good comfortable fashion for the busy artist. It must have
been much easier when you had painted a certain corselet a hundred times to
paint it again than to have to paint all kinds of new colors and stuffs.
And the portrait in armor was almost always kitcat, and that disposed of
the legs, ever a nuisance in portrait-painting.</p>

<p>While the virago-sleeves were growing more and more ornamental, and
engageants were being more and more worn by women, men's sleeves assumed a
most interesting form. The long coat, or cassock, had sleeves which were
cut off at the elbow with great cuffs and were worn over enormous ruffled
undersleeves; and they were even cut midway between shoulder and elbow,
were slashed and pointed and beribboned to a wonderful degree. This lasted
but a few years, the years when the cassock was shaping itself definitely
into a skirted coat. Perhaps the height of ornamentation in sleeves was in
the closing years of the reign of Charles II, though fancy sleeves lingered
till the time of George I.</p>

<p>In an account of the funeral of George Monck, the Duke of Albemarle, in
the year 1670, the dress is very carefully drawn of those who walked in the
procession. (Some of them are given <a
href="#Funeral_Procession.">here</a>.) It may be noted, first, that all the
hats are lower crowned and straight crowned, not like a cone or a truncated
cone, as crowns had been. The <I>Poor Men</I> are in robes with beards and
flowing natural hair; they wear square bands, and carry staves. The
<I>Clergymen</I> wear trailing surplices; but these are over a sort of
cassock and breeches, and they all have high-heeled shoes with great roses.
They also have their own hair. The <I>Doctors of Physic</I> are dressed
like the <I>Gentlemen and Earls</I>, save that they wear a rich robe with
bands at the upper arm, over the other fine dress. The gentlemen wear a
cassock, or coat, which reaches to the knee; the pockets are nearly as low
as the knee. These cassocks have lapels from neck to hem, with a long row
of gold buttons which are wholly for ornament, the cassock never being
fastened with the buttons. The sleeves reach only to the elbow and turn
back in a spreading cuff; and from the elbow hang heavy ruffles and
under-sleeves, some of rich lace, others of embroidery. The gentlemen and
earls wear great wigs.</p>

<p>This coat was called a surcoat or tunic. The under-coat, or waistcoat,
was also called a vest, as by Charles the king.</p>

<p>From this vest, or surcoat, was developed a coat, with skirts, such as
had become, ere the year 1700, the universal wear of English and American
men. Its first form was adopted about at the close of the reign of Charles
II. By 1688 Quaker teachers warned their younger sort against
&quot;cross-pockets on men's coats, side slopes, over-full skirted
coats.&quot;</p>

<p>In an old play a man threatens a country lad, &quot;I'll make your
buttons fly.&quot; The lad replies, &quot;All my buttons is loops.&quot;
Some garments, especially leather ones, like doublets, which were
cumbersome to button, were secured by loops. For instance, in
spatterdashes, a row of holes was set on one side, and of loops on the
other. To fasten them, one must begin at the lower loop, pass this through
the first hole, then put the second loop through that first loop and the
second hole, and so on till the last loop was fastened to the breeches by
buckle and strap or large single button. From these loops were developed
frogs and loops.</p>

<p>Major John Pyncheon had, in 1703, a &quot;light coulour'd cape-coat with
Frogs on it.&quot; In the <i>New England Weekly Journal</i> of 1736
&quot;New Fashion'd Frogs&quot; are named; and later, &quot;Spangled
Scalloped &amp; Brocaded Frogs.&quot;</p>

<p>Though these jerkins and mandillions and doublets which were furnished
to the Bay colonists were fastened with hooks and eyes, buttons were worn
also, as old portraits and old letters prove. John Eliot ordered for
traffic with the Indians, in 1651, three gross of pewter buttons; and
Robert Keayne, of Boston, writing in 1653, said bitterly that a
&quot;haynous offence&quot; of his had been selling buttons at too large
profit--that they were gold buttons and he had sold them for two shillings
ninepence a dozen in Boston, when they had cost but two shillings a dozen
in London (which does not seem, in the light of our modern profits on
imported goods, a very &quot;haynous&quot; offence). He also added with
acerbity that &quot;they were never payd for by those that
complayned.&quot;</p>

<p>Buttonholes were a matter of ornament more than of use; in fact, they
were never used for closing the garment after coats came to be worn. They
were carefully cut and &quot;laid around&quot; in gay colors, embroidered
with silver and gold thread, bound with vellum, with kid, with velvet. We
find in old-time letters directions about modish buttonholes, and drawings
even, in order that the shape may be exactly as wished. An English
contemporary of John Winthrop's has tasselled buttonholes on his
doublet.</p>

<p>Various are the reasons given for the placing of the two buttons on the
back of a man's coat. One is that they are a survival of buttons which were
used on the eighteenth-century riding-coat. The coat-tails were thus
buttoned up when the wearer was on horseback. Another is that they were
used for looping back the skirts of the coats; it is said that loops of
cord were placed at the corners of the said skirts.</p>

<p>A curious anecdote about these two buttons on the back of the coat is
that a tribe of North American Indians, deep believers in the value of
symbolism, refused to heed a missionary because he could not explain to
them the significance of these two buttons.</p>

<p style='text-indent: 0em'> <img src="images\initialw.png" align=left
alt="W">e have in this poem of the old &quot;Water Poet&quot; a definite
statement of the date of the introduction of ruffs for English wear. We are
afforded in the portraiture given in this book ample proof of the fall of
the ruff.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Like many of the most striking fashions of olden times, the ruff was
Spanish. French gentlemen had worn frills or ruffs about 1540; soon after,
these appeared in England; by the date of Elizabeth's accession the ruff
had become the most imposing article of English men's and women's dress. It
was worn exclusively by fine folk; for it was too frail and too costly for
the common wear of the common people, though lawn ruffs were seen on many
of low degree. A ruff such as was worn by a courtier contained eighteen or
nineteen yards of fine linen lawn. A quarter of a yard wide was the
fashionable width in England. Ruffs were carefully pleated in triple
box-plaits as shown in the Bowdoin portrait <a
href="#A_Bowdoin_Portrait.">here</a>. Then they were bound with a firm
neck-binding.</p>

<p>This carefully made ruff was starched with good English or Dutch starch;
fluted with &quot;setting sticks&quot; of wood or bone, to hold each pleat
up; then fixed with struts--also of wood--placed in a manner to hold the
pleats firmly apart; and finally &quot;seared&quot; or goffered with
&quot;poking sticks&quot; of iron or steel, which, duly heated, dried the
stiffening starch. To &quot;do up&quot; a formal ruff was a wearisome,
difficult, and costly precess. Women of skill acquired considerable
fortunes as &quot;gofferers.&quot;</p>

<p>Stubbes tells us further of the rich decoration of ruffs with gold,
silver, and silk lace, with needlework, with openwork, and with purled
lace. This was in Elizabeth's day. John Winthrop's ruff (<a
href="#Governor_John_Winthrop.">here</a>) is edged with lace; in general a
plain ruff was worn by plain gentlemen; one may be seen on Martin Frobisher
(<a href="#A_Doublet.">here</a>). Rich lace was for the court. Their great
cost, their inconvenience, their artificiality, their size, were sure to
make ruffs a &quot;reason of offence&quot; to reformers. Stubbes gave voice
to their complaints in these words:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;They haue great and monstrous ruffes, made either of
cambrike, holland, lawne, or els of some other the finest cloth that can
be got for money, whereof some be a quarter of a yarde deepe, yea, some
more, very few lesse, so that they stande a full quarter of a yearde (and
more) from their necks hanging ouer their shoulder points in steade of a
vaile.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Still more violent does he grow over starch:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The one arch or piller whereby his (the Devil's) kyngdome
of great ruffes is vnderpropped, is a certaine kind of liquid matter,
whiche they call starch, wherein the deuill hath willed them to washe and
dive their ruffes well, whiche, beeying drie, will then stande stiff and
inflexible about their necks.<br> <br> &quot;The other piller is a
certaine device made of wiers, crested for the purpose; whipped over
either with gold thred, silver, or silke, and this he calleth a
supportasse or vnderpropper; this is to bee applied round about their
neckes under the ruffe, upon the out side of the bande, to beare up the
whole frame and bodie of the ruffe, from fallying and hangying
doune.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Starch was of various colors. We read of &quot;blue-starch-women,&quot;
and of what must have been especially ugly, &quot;goose-green starch.&quot;
Yellow starch was most worn. It was introduced from France by the notorious
Mrs. Turner. (See <a
href="#A_Woman's_Doublet._Mrs._Anne_Turner.">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Wither wrote thus of the varying modes of dressing the neck:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Some are graced by their Tyres<br>
As their Quoyfs, their Hats, their Wyres,<br>
One a Ruff cloth best become;<br>
Falling bands allureth some;<br>
And their favours oft we see<br>
Chang&egrave;d as their dressings be.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>The transformation of ruff to band can be seen in the painting of King
Charles I. The first Van Dyck portrait of him shows him in a moderate ruff
turned over to lie down like a collar; the lace edge formed itself by the
pleats into points which developed into the lace points characteristic of
Van Dyck's later pictures and called by his name.</p>

<p>Evelyn, describing a medal of King Charles I struck in 1633, says,
&quot;The King wears a falling band, a new mode which has succeeded the
cumbersome ruff; but neither do the bishops nor the Judges give it up so
soon.&quot; Few of the early colonial portraits show ruffs, though the name
appears in many inventories, but &quot;playne bands&quot; are more
frequently named than ruffs. Thus in an Inventory of William Swift,
Plymouth, 1642, he had &quot;2 Ruff Bands and 4 Playne Bands.&quot; The
&quot;playne band&quot; of the Puritans is shown in this portrait of
William Pyncheon, which is dated 1657.</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>The first change from the full pleated ruff of the sixteenth century
came in the adoption of a richly laced collar, unpleated, which still stood
up behind the ears at the back of the head. Often it was wired in place
with a supportasse. This was worn by both men and women. You may see one <a
href="#Pocahontas.">here</a>, on the neck of Pocahontas, her portrait
painted in 1616. This collar, called a standing-band, when turned down was
known as a falling-band or a rebato.</p>

<p>The rich lace falling-band continued to be worn until the great flowing
wig, with long, heavy curls, covered the entire shoulders and hid any band;
the floating ends in front were the only part visible. In time they too
vanished. Pepys wrote in 1662, &quot;Put on my new lace band and so neat;
am resolved my great expense shall be lace bands, and it will set off
anything else the more.&quot;</p>

<p>I scarcely need to point out the falling-band in its various shapes as
worn in America; they can be found readily in the early pages of this book.
It was a fashion much discussed and at first much disliked; but the ruff
had seen its last day--for men's wear, when the old fellows who had worn it
in the early years of the seventeenth century dropped off as the century
waned. The old Bowdoin gentleman must have been one of the last to wear
this cumbersome though stately adjunct of dress--save as it was displaced
on some formal state occasion or as part of a uniform or livery.</p>

<p>There is a constant tendency in all times and among all English-speaking
folk to shorten names and titles for colloquial purposes; and soon the
falling-band became the fall. In the <i>Wits' Recreation</i> are two
epigrams which show the thought of the times:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;WHY WOMEN WEARE A FALL<br>
<br>
&quot;A Question 'tis why Women wear a fall?<br>
And truth it is to Pride they're given all.<br>
And <i>Pride</i>, the proverb says, <i>will have a fall</i>.&quot;<br>
<br><br>
 &quot;ON A LITTLE DIMINUTIVE BAND<br>
<br>
&quot;What is the reason of God-dam-me's band,<br>
Inch deep? and that his fashion doth not alter,<br>
God-dam-me saves a labor, understand<br>
In pulling it off, where he puts on the Halter.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>&quot;God-dam-me&quot; was one of the pleasant epithets which, by scores, were
applied to the Puritans.</p>

<br><br>
<center>
<a name="Reverend_Jonathan_Edwards."></a>
<img src="images\230.png" alt="Reverend Jonathan Edwards.">
<H4>Reverend Jonathan Edwards.</H4>
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The bands worn by the learned professions, two strips of lawn with
squared ends, were at first the elongated ends of the shirt collar of
Jonathan Edwards. We have them still, to remind us of old fashions; and we
have another word and thing, band-box, which must have been a stern
necessity in those days of starch, and ruff, and band.</p>

<p>It was by no means a convention of dress that &quot;God-dam-me&quot;
should wear a small band. Neither Cromwell nor his followers clung long to
plain bands; nor did they all assume them. It would be wholly impossible to
generalize or to determine the standing of individuals, either in politics
or religion, by their neckwear. I have before me a little group of prints
of men of Cromwell's day, gathered for extra illustration of a history of
Cromwell's time. Let us glance at their bands.</p>

<p>First comes Cromwell himself from the Cooper portrait at Cambridge; this
portrait has a plain linen turnover collar, or band, but two to three
inches wide. Then his father is shown in a very broad, square, plain linen
collar extending in front expanse from shoulder seam to shoulder seam. Sir
Harry Vane and Hampden, both Puritans, have narrow collars like Cromwell's;
Pym, an equally precise sectarian, has a broader one like the father's, but
apparently of some solid and rich embroidery like cut-work. Edward Hyde,
the Earl of Clarendon, in narrow band, Lucius Cary, Lord Falkland, in band
and band-strings, were members of the Long Parliament, but passed in time
to the Royal Camp. Other portraits of both noblemen are in richly laced
bands. The Earl of Bristol, who was in the same standing, has the widest of
lace, Vandyked collars. John Selden wears the plain band; but here is
Strafford, the very impersonation of all that was hated by Puritans, and
yet he wears the simplest of puritanical bands. William Lenthal, Speaker of
the House of Commons, is in a beautiful Cavalier collar with straight lace
edges. There are a score more, equally indifferent to rule.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, that the Puritan regarded his plain band--if
he wore it--with jealous care. Poor Mary Downing, niece of Governor
Winthrop, paid dearly for her careless &quot;searing,&quot; or ironing, of
her brother's bands. Her stepmother's severity at her offence brought forth
this plaintive letter:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Father, I trust that I have not provoked you to harbour
soe ill an opinion of mee as my mothers lettres do signifie and give me
to understand; the ill opinion and hard pswasion which shee beares of mee,
that is to say, that I should abuse yor goodness, and bee prodigall of yor
purse, neglectful of my brothers bands, and of my slatterishnes and
lasines; for my brothers bands I will not excuse myselfe, but I thinke not
worthy soe sharpe a reproofe; for the rest I must needs excuse, and cleare
myselfe if I may bee believed. I doe not know myselfe guilty of any of
them; for myne owne part I doe not desire to be myne owne judge, but am
willinge to bee judged by them with whom I live, and see my course,
whether I bee addicted to such things or noe.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Ruffs and bands were not the only neckwear of the colonists. Very soon
there was a tendency to ornament the band-strings with tassels of silk,
with little tufts of ribbon, with tiny rosettes, with jewels even; and soon
a graceful frill of lace hung where the band was tied together. This may be
termed the beginning of the necktie or cravat; but the article itself
enjoyed many names, and many forms, which in general extended both to men's
and women's wear.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Let us turn to the old inventories for the various names of this
neckwear.</p>

<p>A Maryland gentleman left by will, with other attire, in 1642,
&quot;Nine laced stripps, two plain stripps, nine quoifes, one call, eight
crosse-cloths, a paire holland sleeves, a paire women's cuffs, nine plaine
neck-cloths, five laced neck-cloths, two plaine gorgetts, seven laced
gorgetts, three old clouts, five plaine neckhandkerchiefs, two plain
shadowes.&quot;</p>

<p>John Taylor, the &quot;Water Poet,&quot; wrote a poem entitled The
Needles Excellency. I quote from the twelfth edition, dated 1640. In the
list of garments which we owe to the needle he names:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Shadows, Shapparoones, Cauls, Bands, Ruffs, Kuffs,<br>
Kerchiefs, Quoyfes, Chin-clouts, Marry-muffes,<br>
Cross-cloths, Aprons, Hand-kerchiefs, or Falls.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>His list runs like that of the Maryland planter. The strip was something
like the whisk; indeed, the names seem interchangeable. Bishop Hall in his
<i>Satires</i> writes:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;When a plum'd fan may hide thy chalked face<br>
And lawny strips thy naked bosom grace.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Smith wrote in 1658 in <i>Penelope and Ulysses</i>:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;A stomacher upon her breast so bare<br>
For strips and gorget were not then the wear.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>The gorget was the frill in front; the strip the lace cape or whisk. It
will be noted that nine gorgets are named with these strips.</p>

<p>The gorget when worn by women was enriched with lace and needlework.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;These Holland smocks as white as snow<br>
And gorgets brave with drawn-work wrought<br>
A tempting ware they are you know.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Thus runs a poem published in 1596.</p>

<p>Mary Verney writes in 1642 her desire for &quot;gorgetts and eyther cutt
or painted callico to wear under them or what is most in fashion.&quot;</p>

<p>The shadow has been a great stumbling-block to antiquaries. Purchas's
<i>Pilgrimage</i> is responsible for what is to me a very confusing
reference. It says of a certain savage race:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;They have a skin of leather hanging about their necks
whenever they sit bare-headed and bare-footed, with their right arms bare;
and a broad Sombrero or Shadow in their hands to defend them in Summer
from the Sunne, in Winter from the Rain.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>This would make a shadow a sort of hand-screen or sunshade; but all
other references seem as if a shadow were a cap. As early as 1580, Richard
Fenner's Wardship Roll has &quot;Item a Caul and Shadoe 4 shillings.&quot;
I think a shadow was a great cap like a cornet. Cross-cloths were a form of
head-dress. I have seen old portraits with a cap or head-dress formed of
crossed bands which I have supposed were cross-cloths.</p>

<p>Cross-cloths also bore a double meaning; for certainly neck-cloths or
neckerchiefs were sometimes called cross-cloths or cross-clothes. Another
name is the picardill or piccadilly, a French title for a gorget.
Fitzgerald, in 1617, wrote of &quot;a spruse coxcomb&quot; that he glanced
at his pocket looking-glass to see:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;How his Band jumpeth with his Peccadilly<br>
Whether his Band-strings ballance equally.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Another satirical author could write in 1638 that &quot;pickadillies are
now out of request.&quot;</p>

<p>The portrait of Captain Curwen of Salem (<a
href="#Captain_George_Curwen.">here</a>) is unlike many of his times. Over
his doublet he wears a handsome embroidered shoulder sash called a
trooping-scarf; and his broad lace tie is very unusual for the year 1660. I
know few like it upon American gentlemen in portraits; and I fancy it is a
gorget, or a piccadilly. It is pleasant to know that this handsome piece of
lace has been preserved. It is here shown with his cane.</p>

<p>A little negative proof may be given as to one word and article. The
gorget is said to be an adaptation of the wimple. Our writers of historical
tales are very fond of attiring their heroines in wimples and kirtles. Both
have a picturesque, an antique, sound--the wimple is Biblical and
Shakesperian, and therefore ever satisfying to the ear, and to the sight in
manuscript. But I have never seen the word wimple in an inventory, list,
invoice, letter, or book of colonial times, and but once the word kirtle.
Likewise are these modern authors a bit vague as to the manner of garment a
wimple is. One fair maid is described as having her fair form wrapped in a
warm wimple. She might as well be described as wrapped in a warm cravat.
For a wimple was simply a small kerchief or covering for the neck, worn in
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Another quaint term, already obsolete when the <i>Mayflower</i> sailed,
was partlet. A partlet was an inner kerchief, worn with an open-necked
bodice or doublet. Its trim plaited edge or ruffle seems to have given rise
to the popular name, &quot;Dame Partlet,&quot; for a hen. It appeared in
the reign of Henry VIII; the courtiers imitating the king threw open their
garments at the throat, and further opened them with slashes; hence the use
of the partlet, which was a trim form of underhabit or gorget, worn well up
to the throat. An old dictionary explains that the partlet can be &quot;set
on or taken off by itself without taking off the bodice, as can be
pickadillies now-a-days, or men's bands.&quot; It adds that women's
neckerchiefs have been called partlets.</p>

<p>In October, 1662, Samuel Pepys wrote in his <i>Diary</i>, &quot;Made
myself fine with Captain Ferrers lace band; being loathe to wear my own new
scallop; it is so fine.&quot; This is one of his several references to this
new fashion of band which both he and his wife adopted. He paid &pound;3
for his scallop, and 45s. for one for his wife. He was so satisfied with
his elegance in this new scallop, that like many another lover of dress he
determined his chief extravagance should be for lace. The fashion of
scallop-wearing came to America. For several years the word was used in
inventories, then it became as obsolete as a caul, a shadow, a cornet.</p>

<p>The word &quot;cravat&quot; is not very ancient. Its derivation is said
to be from the Cravates or Croats in the French military service, who
adopted such neckwear in 1636. An early use of the word is by Blount in
1656, who called a cravat &quot;a new fashioned Gorget which Women
wear.&quot;</p>

<p>The cravat is a distinct companion of the wig, and was worn whenever and
wherever wigs were donned.</p>

<p>Evelyn gave the year 1666 as the one when vest, cravat, garters, and
buckles came to be the fashion. We could add likewise wigs. Of course all
these had been known before that year, but had not been general wear.</p>

<p>An early example of a cravat is shown in the portrait of old William
Stoughton in my later chapter on Cloaks. His cravat is a distinctly new
mode of neck-dressing, but is found on all American portraits shortly after
that date. One is shown with great exactness in the portrait <a
href="#Governor_Coddington.">here</a>, which is asserted to be that of
&quot;the handsomest man in the Plantations,&quot; William Coddington,
Governor of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.</p>

<br><br>

<p>He was a precise man, and wearisome in his precision--a bore, even, I
fear. His beauty went for little in his relation of man to man, and, above
all, of colonist to colonist; and poor Governor Winthrop must have been
sorely tormented with his frequent letters, which might have been written
from Mars for all the signs they bore of news of things of this earth. His
dress is very neat and rich--a characteristic dress, I think. It has
slightly wrought buttonholes, plain sleeve ruffles and gloves. His full
curled peruke has a mass of long curls hanging in front of the right
shoulder, while the curls on the left side are six or eight inches shorter.
This was the most elegant London fashion, and extreme fashion too. His
neck-scarf or cravat was a characteristic one. It consisted of a long scarf
of soft, fine, sheer, white linen over two yards long, passed twice or
thrice close around the throat and simply lapped under the chin, not
knotted. The upper end hung from twelve to sixteen inches long. The other
and longer end was carried down to a low waistline and tucked in between
the buttons of the waistcoat. Often the free end of this scarf was trimmed
with lace or cut-work; indeed, the whole scarf might be of embroidery or
lace, but the simpler lawn or mull appears to have been in better taste.
This tie is seen in this portrait of Thomas Fayerweather, by Smybert, and
in modified forms on many other pages.</p>

<p>We now find constant references to the Steinkirk, a new cravat. As we
see it frequently stated that the Steinkirk was a black tie, I may state
here that all the Steinkirks I have seen have been white. I know no
portraits with black neck-cloths. I find no allusions in old-time
literature or letters to black Steinkirks.</p>

<p>A Steinkirk was a white cravat, not knotted, but fastened so loosely as
to seem folded rather than tied, twisted sometimes twice or thrice, with
one or both ends passed through a buttonhole of the coat. Ladies wore them,
as well as men, arranged with equal appearance of careless negligence; and
the soft diagonal folds of linen and lace made a pretty finish at the
throat, as pretty as any high neck-dressing could be. These cravats were
called Steinkirks after the battle of Steinkirk, when some of the French
princes, not having time to perform an elaborate toilet before going into
action, hurriedly twisted their lace cravats about their necks and pulled
them through a buttonhole, simply to fix them safely in place. The
fashionable world eagerly followed their example. It is curious that the
Steinkirk should have been popular in England, where the name might rather
have been a bitter avoidance.</p>

<p>The battle of Steinkirk took place in 1694. An early English allusion to
the neckwear thus named is in <i>The Relapse</i>, which was acted in 1697.
In it the Semstress says, &quot;I hope your Lordship is pleased with your
Steenkirk.&quot; His Lordship answers with eloquence, &quot;In love with
it, stap my vitals! Bring your bill, you shall be paid tomorrow!&quot;</p>

<p>The Steinkirk, both for men's and women's wear, came to America very
promptly, and was soon widely worn. The dashing, handsome figure of young
King Carter gives an illustration of the pretty studied negligence of the
Steinkirk. I have seen a Steinkirk tie on at least twenty portraits of
American gentlemen, magistrates, and officers; some of them were the royal
governors, but many were American born and bred, who never visited Europe,
but turned eagerly to English fashions.</p>

<p>Certain old families have preserved among their ancient treasures a very
long oval brooch with a bar across it from end to end--the longest way of
the brooch. These are set sometimes with topaz or moonstone, garnet,
marcasite, heliotropium, or paste jewels. Many wonder for what purpose
these were used. They were to hold the lace Steinkirk in place, when it was
not pulled through the buttonhole. The bar made it seem like a tongueless
buckle--or perhaps it was like a long, narrow buckle to which a brooch pin
had been affixed to keep it firmly in place.</p>

<p>The cravat, tied and twisted in Steinkirk form, or more simply folded,
long held its place in fashionable dress.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The stock with buckle made of paste<br>
Has put the cravat out of date,&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>wrote Whyte in 1742.</p>

<p>With this quotation we will turn from neckwear until a later period.</p>

alt="A">ny student of English history and letters would know that caps
would positively be part of the outfit of every emigrating Englishman. A
cap was, for centuries, both the enforced and desired headwear of English
folk of quiet lives.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Belgic Britons, Welshmen, Irish, Anglo-Saxons, Danes, and Normans all
had worn caps, as well as ancient Greeks and Romans. These English caps had
been of divers colors and manifold forms, some being grotesque indeed. When
we reach the reign of Henry VIII we are made familiar in the paintings of
Holbein with a certain flat-cap which sometimes had a small jewel or
leather or a double fold, but never varied greatly. This was known as the
city flat-cap.</p>

<p>It is shown also in the Holbein portrait of Adam Winthrop, grandfather
of Governor John Winthrop; he was a man of dignity, Master of the Cloth
Workers' Guild.</p>

<p>The muffin-cap of the boys of Christ's Hospital is a form of this
cap.</p>

<p>This was at first and ever a Londoner's cap. A poet wrote in 1630:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Flat caps as proper are to city gowns<br>
As to armour, helmets, or to kings, their crowns.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Winthrop also wears the city gown.</p>

<p>This flat-cap was often of gay colors, scarlet being a favorite hue.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Behold the bonnet upon my head<br>
A staryng colour of scarlet red<br>
I promise you a fyne thred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a soft wool<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cost a noble.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>These lines were written for the character &quot;Pride,&quot; in the
<i>Interlude of Nature</i>, before the year 1500.</p>

<p>A statute was passed in 1571, &quot;If any person above six years of age
(except maidens, ladies, gentlemen, nobles, knights, gentlemen of twenty
marks by year in lands, and their heirs, and such as have born office of
worship) have not worn upon the Sunday or holyday (except it be in the time
of his travell out of the city, town or hamlet where he dwelleth) one cap
of wool, knit, thicked and dressed in England, and only dressed and
furnished by some of the trade of cappers, shall be fined &pound;3 4d. for
each day's transgression.&quot; The caps thus worn were called Statute
caps.</p>

<p>This was, of course, to encourage wool-workers in the pride of the
nation. Winthrop, master of a guild whose existence depended on wool,
would, of course, wear a woollen cap had he not been a Londoner. It was a
plain head-covering, but it was also the one worn by King Edward VI.</p>

<p>There was a formal coif or cap worn by men of dignity; always worn, I
think, by judges and elderly lawyers, ere the assumption of the formal wig.
This coif may be seen on the head of the venerable Dr. Dee, and also on the
head of Lord Burleigh, and of Thomas Cecil, surmounted with the citizen's
flat-cap. One of these caps in heavy black lustring lingered by chance in
my home--worn by some forgotten ancestor. It had a curious loop, as may be
seen on Dr. Dee. This was not a narrow string for tying the coif on the
head; it was a loop. And if there was any need of fastening the cap on the
head, a narrow ribbon or ferret, a lacing, was put through both loops.</p>

<p>In the inventory of the apparel of the first settlers which I have given
in the early pages of this book, we find that each colonist to the
Massachusetts Bay settlement had one Monmouth cap and five red milled caps.
All the lists of necessary clothing for the planters have as an item, caps;
but a well-made, well-lined hat was also supplied.</p>

<p>Monmouth caps were in general wear in England. Thomas Fuller said,
&quot;Caps were the most ancient, general, warm, and profitable coverings
of men's heads in this Island.&quot; In making them thousands of people
were employed, especially before the invention of fulling-mills, when caps
were wrought, beaten, and thickened by the hands and feet of men.
Cap-making afforded occupation to fifteen different callings: carders,
spinners, knitters, parters of wool, forcers, thickers, dressers, walkers,
dyers, battellers, shearers, pressers, edgers, liners, and band-makers.</p>

<p>The Monmouth caps were worth two shillings each, which were furnished to
the Massachusetts colonists. These were much affected by seafaring men. We
read, in <i>A Satyr on Sea Officers</i>, &quot;With Monmouth cap and
cutlass at my side, striding at least a yard at every stride.&quot;
&quot;The Ballad of the Caps,&quot; 1656, gives a wonderful list of caps.
Among them are:</p>

<blockquote>The Monmouth Cap, the Saylors thrum,<br>
And that wherein the tradesmen come,<br>
The Physick, Lawe, the Cap divine,<br>
And that which crowns the Muses nine,<br>
The Cap that Fools do countenance,<br>
The goodly Cap of Maintenance,<br>
And any Cap what e're it be,<br>
Is still the sign of some degree.<br>
<br>
&quot;The sickly Cap both plaine and wrought,<br>
The Fuddling-cap however bought,<br>
The quilted, furred, the velvet, satin,<br>
For which so many pates learn Latin,<br>
The Crewel Cap, the Fustian pate,<br>
The Perriwig, the Cap of Late,<br>
And any Cap what e'er it be<br>
Is still the sign of some degree.&quot;<br>
<br>
--&quot;Ballad of the Caps,&quot; 1656.<br></blockquote>

<p>We seldom have in manuscript or print, in America, titles or names given
to caps or hats, but one occasionally seen is the term
&quot;montero-cap,&quot; spelled also mountero, montiro, montearo; and
Washington Irving tells of &quot;the cedar bird with a little mon-teiro-cap
of feathers.&quot; Montero-caps were frequently recommended to emigrants,
and useful dress they were, being a horseman's or huntsman's cap with a
simple round crown, and a flap which went around the sides and back of the
cap and which could be worn turned up or brought down over the back of the
neck, the ears and temples, thus making a most protecting head-covering.
They were, in general, dark colored, of substantial woollen stuff, but
Sterne writes in Tristram Shandy of a montero-cap which he describes as of
superfine Spanish cloth, dyed scarlet in the grain, mounted all round with
fur, except four inches in front, which was faced with light blue lightly
embroidered. It is a montero-cap which is seen on the head of Bamfylde
Moore Carew, the &quot;King of the Mumpers,&quot; a most genial English
rogue, sneak-thief, and cheat of the eighteenth century, who spent some of
his ill-filled years in the American colonies, whither he was brought after
being trepanned, and where he had to bear the ignominy of wearing an iron
collar welded around his neck.</p>

<p>A montero-cap seems to have been the favorite dress of rogues. In Head's
<i>English Rogue</i> we read, &quot;Beware of him that rides in a
montero-cap and of him that whispers oft.&quot; The picaro Guzman wore one;
and as montero is the Spanish word for huntsman, Head may have obtained the
word from that special scamp, Guzman, whose life was published in 1633. It
is a very ancient name, being given in Cotgrave as a hood, or as the
horseman's helmet. It is worn still by Arctic travellers and Alpine
climbers. Sets of knitted montero-caps were presented by the Empress
Eugenie to the Arctic expedition of 1875, and the Jackies dubbed them
&quot;Eugenie Wigs.&quot;</p>

<p>Another and widely different class of men wore likewise the montero-cap,
the English and American Quakers. Thomas Ellwood, in the early days of his
Quaker belief, suffered much for his hat, both from his fellow Quakers and
his father, a Church of England man. The Quakers thought his &quot;large
Mountier cap of black velvet, the skirt of which being turned up in Folds
looked somewhat above the common Garb of a Quaker.&quot; A young priest at
another time snatched this montero-cap off because he wore it in the
presence of magistrates, and then Ellwood's father fell upon it in this
wise:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;He could not contain himself but running upon me with
both hands, first violently snatcht off my Hat and threw it away and then
giving me some buffets in the head said Sirrah get you up to your chamber.
I had now lost one hat and had but one more. The next Time my Father saw
it on my head he tore it violently from me and laid it up with the other,
I know not where. Wherefore I put my Mountier Cap which was all I had left
to wear on my head, and but a little while I had that, for when my Father
came where I was, I lost that also.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<br><br>

<p>Finally the father refused to let him wear his &quot;Hive,&quot; as he
called the hat, at the table while eating, and thereafter Ellwood ate with
his father's servants.</p>

<p>The vogue of beaver hats was an important factor in the settlement of
America.</p>

<p>The first Spanish, Dutch, English, and French colonists all came to
America to seek for gold and furs. The Spaniards found gold, the Dutch and
French found furs, but the English who found fish found the greatest wealth
of all, for food is ever more than raiment.</p>

<p>Of the furs the most important and most valuable was beaver. The English
sent some beaver back to Europe; the very first ship to return from
Plymouth carried back two hogsheads. Winslow sent twenty hogsheads as early
as 1634, and Bradford shows that the trade was deemed important. But the
wild creatures speedily retreated. Johnson declares that as early as 1645
the beaver trade had left the frontier post of Springfield, on the
Connecticut River.</p>

<p>From the earliest days both the French and English crown had treated the
fishing and fur industries with unusual discretion, giving a monopoly to
the fur trade and leaving the fisheries free, so the latter constantly
increased, while in New England the fur trade passed over to the Dutch,
distinctly to the advantage of the English, for the lazy trader at a post
was neither a good savage nor a good citizen, while the hardy fishermen and
bold sailors of New England brought wealth to every town. For some years
the Dutch appeared to have the best of it, for they received ten to fifteen
thousand beaver skins annually from New England; and they had trading-posts
on Narragansett and Buzzards Bay. Still the trade drew the Dutch away from
agriculture, and the real success of New Netherland did not come with furs,
but with corn.</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>The fur trade was certainly an interesting factor in the growth of the
Dutch settlement. Fort Orange, or Albany, called the <i>Fuyck</i>, was the
natural topographical <i>fuyck</i> or trap-net to catch this trade, and in
the very first season of its settlement fifteen hundred beaver and five
hundred otter skins were despatched to Holland. In 1657 Johannes Dyckman
asserted that 40,900 beaver and otter skins were sent that year from Fort
Orange to Fort Amsterdam (New York City). As these skins were valued at
from eight to ten guilders apiece (about $3.50 and with a purchasing value
equal to $20 to-day), it can readily be seen what a source of wealth seemed
opened. The authorities at Fort Orange, the patroons of Renssalaerwyck and
Beverwyck, were not to be permitted to absorb all this wondrous gain in
undisturbed peace. The increment of the India Company was diverted and
hindered in various ways. Unscrupulous and crafty citizens of Fort Orange
(independent <i>handaelers</i> or handlers) and their thrifty,
penny-turning <i>vrouws</i> decoyed the Indian trappers and hunters into
their peaceful, honest kitchens under pretence of kindly Christian welcome
to the peltry-bearing braves; and they filled the guileless savages with
Dutch schnapps, or Barbadoes &quot;kill-devil,&quot; until the befuddled or
half-crazed Indians parted with their precious stores of hard-trapped skins
and threw off their well-perspired and greased beaver coats and exchanged
them for such valuable Dutch wares as knives, scissors, beads, and
jews'-harps, or even a few pints of quickly vanishing rum, instead of solid
Dutch guilders or substantial Dutch blankets. And even before these
strategic Dutch citizens could corral and fleece them, the incoming
fur-bearers had to run as insinuating a gantlet of <i>boschloopers</i>,
bush-runners, drummers, or &quot;broakers,&quot; who sallied out on the
narrow Indian paths to buy the coveted furs even before they were brought
into Fort Orange. Much legislation ensued. Scout-buying was prohibited.
Citizens were forbidden &quot;to addresse to speak to the wilden of
trading,&quot; or to entice them to &quot;traffique,&quot; or to harbor
them over night. Indian houses to lodge the trappers were built just
outside the gate, where the dickering would be public. These were built by
rates collected from all &quot;Christian dealers&quot; in furs.</p>

<p>But Indian paths were many, and the water-ways were unpatrolled, and
kitchen doors could be slyly opened in the dusk; so the government, in
spite of laws and shelter-houses, did not get all the beaver skins. Too
many were eager for the lucrative and irregular trade; agricultural
pursuits were alarmingly neglected; other communities became rivals, and
the beavers soon were exterminated from the valley of the Hudson, and by
1660 the Fort Orange trade was sadly diminished. The governor of Canada had
an itching palm, and lured the Indians--and beaver skins--to Montreal. Thus
&quot;impaired by French wiles,&quot; scarce nine thousand peltries came in
1687 to Fort Orange. With a few fluttering rallies until Revolutionary
times the fur trade of Albany became extinct; it passed from both Dutch and
French, and was dominated by the Hudson Bay Fur Company.</p>

<p>So clear a description of the fur of the beaver and the use of the pelt
was given by Adriaen van der Donck, who lived at Fort Orange from the year
1641 to 1646, and traded for years with the Indians, that it is well to
give his exact words:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The beaver's skin is rough but thickly set with fine fur
of an ash-gray color inclining to blue. The outward points also incline
to a russet or brown color. From the fur of the beaver the best hats are
made that are worn. They are called beavers or castoreums from the
material of which they are made, and they are known by this name over all
Europe. Outside of the coat of fur many shining hairs appear called
wind-hairs, which are more properly winter-hairs, for they fall out in
summer and appear again in winter. The outer coat is of a chestnut-brown
color, the browner the color the better is the fur. Sometimes it will be a
little reddish.<br> <br> &quot;When hats are made of the fur, the rough
hairs are pulled out for they are useless. The skins are usually first
sent to Russia, where they are highly valued for their outside shining
hair, and on this their greatest recommendation depends with the Russians.
The skins are used there for mantle-linings and are also cut into strips
for borders, as we cut rabbit-skins. Therefore we call the same peltries.
Whoever has there the most and costliest fur-trimmings is deemed a person
of very high rank, as with us the finest stuffs and gold and silver
embroideries are regarded as the appendages of the great. After the hairs
have fallen out, or are worn, and the peltries become old and dirty and
apparently useless, we get the article back, and convert the fur into
hats, before which it cannot be well used for this purpose, for unless the
beaver has been worn, and is greasy and dirty, it will not felt properly,
hence these old peltries are the most valuable. The coats which the
Indians make of beaver-skins and which they have worn for a long time
around their bodies until the skins have become foul with perspiration and
grease are afterwards used by the hatters and make the best

<p>One notion about beaver must be told. Its great popularity for many
years arose, it is conjectured, from its original use as a cap for curative
purposes. Such a beaver cap would &quot;unfeignedly&quot; recover to a man
his hearing, and stimulate his memory to a wonder, especially if the
&quot;oil of castor&quot; was rubbed in his hair.</p>

<p>The beaver hat was for centuries a choice and costly article of dress;
it went through many bizarre forms. On the head of Henry IV of France and
Navarre, as made known in his portrait, is a hat which effectually destroys
all possibility of dignity. It is a bell-crowned stove-pipe, of the precise
shape worn later by coachmen and by dandies about the years 1820 to 1830.
It is worn very much over one royal ear, like the hat of a well-set-up,
self-important coachman of the palmy days of English coaching, and gives an
air of absurd modernity and cockney importance to the picture of a king of
great dignity. The hat worn by James I, ere he was King of England, is
shown <a href="#King_James_I_of_England.">here</a>. It is funnier than any
seen for years in a comic opera. The hat worn by Francis Bacon is a plain
felt, greatly in contrast with his rich laced triple ruff and cuffs and
embroidered garments. That of Thomas Cecil <a href="#Thomas_Cecil">here</a>
varies slightly.</p>

<p>Two very singular shapings of the plain hat may be seen, one <a
href="#Fulke_Greville_(Lord_Brooke).">here</a> on the head of Fulke
Greville, where the round-topped, high crown is most disproportionate to
the narrow brim. The second, <a
href="#James_Douglas_(Earl_of_Morton).">here</a>, shows an extreme
sugar-loaf, almost a pointed crown.</p>

<p>A good hat was very expensive, and important enough to be left among
bequests in a will. They were borrowed and hired for many years, and even
down to the time of Queen Anne we find the rent of a <i>subscription
hat</i> to be &pound;2 6s. per annum! The hiring out of a hat does not seem
strange when hiring out clothes was a regular business with tailors. The
wife of a person of low estate hired a gown of Queen Elizabeth's to be
married in. Tailor Thomas Gylles complained of the Yeoman of the queen's
wardrobe for suffering this. He writes, &quot;The copper cloth of gold
gowns which were made last, and another, were sent into the country for the
marriage of Lord Montague.&quot; The bequest of half-worn garments was
highly regarded. On the very day of Darnley's funeral, Mary Queen of Scots
gave his clothes to Bothwell, who sent them to his tailor to be refitted.
The tailor, bold with the riot and disorder of the time, returned them with
the impudent message that &quot;the duds of dead men were given to the
hangman.&quot; The duds of men who were hanged were given to the hangman
almost as long as hangings took place. A poor New England girl, hanged for
the murder of her child, went to the scaffold in her meanest attire, and
taunted the executioner that he would get but a poor suit of clothes from
her. The last woman hanged in Massachusetts wore a white satin gown, which
I expect the sheriff's daughter much revelled in the following winter at
dancing-parties.</p>

<p>Old Philip Stubbes has given us a wonderful description of English
head-gear:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;HATS OF SUNDRIE FATIONS&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote> &quot;Sometymes they vse them sharpe on the Croune, pearking
vp like the Spire, or Shaft of a Steeple, standyng a quarter of a yarde
aboue the Croune of their heades, somemore, some lesse, as please the
phantasies of their inconstant mindes. Othersome be flat and broad on the
Crowne, like the battlemetes of a house. An other sorte haue rounde
Crownes, sometymes with one kinde of Band, sometymes with another, now
black, now white, now russet, now red, now grene, now yellowe, now this,
now that, never content with one colour or fashion two daies to an ende.
And thus in vanitie they spend the Lorde his treasure, consuming their
golden yeres and siluer daies in wickednesse and sinne. And as the
fashions bee rare and strange, so is the stuffe whereof their hattes be
made divers also; for some are of Silke, some of Veluet, some of Taffatie,
some of Sarcenet, some of Wooll, and, whiche is more curious, some of a
certaine kinde of fine Haire; these they call Bever hattes, or xx. xxx. or
xl. shillinges price, fetched from beyonde the seas, from whence a greate
sorte of other vanities doe come besides. And so common a thing it is,
that euery seruyngman, countrieman, and other, euen all indefferently,
dooe weare of these hattes. For he is of no account or estimation amongst
men if he haue not a Veluet or Taffatie hatte, and that must be Pincked,
and Cunnyngly Carved of the beste fashion. And good profitable hattes be
these, for the longer you weare them the fewer holes they haue. Besides
this, of late there is a new fashion of wearyng their hattes sprong vp
amongst them, which they father vpon a Frenchman, namely, to weare them
with bandes, but how vnsemely (I will not saie how hassie) a fashion that
is let the wise judge; notwithstanding, howeuer it be, if it please them,
it shall not displease me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;And another sort (as phantasticall as the rest) are
content with no kinde of hat without a greate Bunche of Feathers of diuers
and sondrie Colours, peakyng on top of their heades, not vnlike (I dare
not saie) Cockescombes, but as sternes of pride, and ensignes of vanity.
And yet, notwithstanding these Flutterying Sailes, and Feathered Flagges
of defiaunce of Vertue (for so they be) are so advanced that euery child
hath them in his Hat or Cap; many get good liuing by dying and selling of
them, and not a few proue the selues more than Fooles in wearyng of
them.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding this list of Stubbes, it is very curious to note that in
general the shape of the real beaver hat remained the same as long as it
was worn uncocked.</p>

<p>The hat was worn much more constantly within-doors than in the present
day. Pepys states that they were worn in church; even the preacher wore his
hat. Hats were removed in the presence of royalty. An hereditary honor and
privilege granted to one of my ancestors was that he might wear his hat
before the king.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to find out the exact date when the wearing of
hats by men within-doors ceased to be fashionable and became distinctly low
bred. We can turn to contemporary art. In 1707 at a grand banquet given in
France to the Spanish Embassy, a ceremonious state affair with the women in
magnificent full-dress, the men seated at the table and in the presence of
royalty wore their cocked hats--so much for courtly France.</p>

<p>This wearing of the hat in church, at table, and elsewhere that seems
now strange to us, was largely as an emblem of dignity and authority. Miss
Moore in the <i>Caldwell Papers</i> writes of her grandfather:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I' my grandfather's time, as I have heard him tell, ilka
maister of a family had his ain seat in his ain house; aye, and sat there
with his hat on, afore the best in the land; and had his ain dish, and was
aye helpit first and keepit up his authority as a man should so. Parents
were parents then; and bairns dared not set up their gabs afore them as
they do now.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>That the covering of the head in church still has a significance on
important occasions, is shown by a rubric from the &quot;Form and
Order&quot; for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra; this
provides that the king remains uncovered during the saying of the Litany
and the beginning of the Communion Service, but when the sermon begun that
he should put on his &quot;Cap of crimson velvet turned up with Ermine, and
so continue,&quot; to the end of the discourse.</p>

<p>Hatbands were just as important for men's hats as women's--especially
during the years of the reign of James I. Endymion Porter had his wife's
diamond necklace to wear on his hat in Spain. It probably looked like paste
beside the gorgeousness of the Duke of Buckingham, who had &quot;the Mirror
of France,&quot; a great diamond, the finest in England, &quot;to wear
alone in your hat with a little blacke feather,&quot; so the king wrote
him. A more curious hat ornament was a glove.</p>

<H4>Hat with a Glove as a Favor.</H4>
</center>
<br><br>

<p>This handsome hat is from a portrait of George, Earl of Cumberland. It
has a woman's glove as a favor. This is said to have been a gift of Queen
Elizabeth after his prowess in a tournament. He always wore this glove on
state occasions. Gloves were worn on a hat in three meanings: as a memorial
of a dead friend, as a favor of a mistress, or as a mark of challenge. A
pretty laced or tasselled handkerchief was also a favor and was worn like a
cockade.</p>

<p>An excellent representation of the Cavalier hat may be seen on the
figure of Oliver Cromwell <a
href="#Cromwell_dissolving_Parliament.">(here</a>), which shows him
dismissing Parliament. Cornelius Steinwyck's flat-leafed hat has no
feather.</p>

<p>The steeple-crowned hat of both men and women was in vogue in the second
half of the seventeenth century in both England and America, at the time
when the witchcraft tragedies came to a culmination. The long scarlet cloak
was worn at the same date. It is evident that the conventional witch of
to-day, an old woman in scarlet cloak and steeple-crowned hat, is a relic
of that day. Through the striking circumstances and the striking dress was
struck off a figurative type which is for all time.</p>

<p>William Kempe of &quot;Duxburrow&quot; in 1641 left hats, hat-boxes,
rich hatbands, bone laces, leather hat-cases; also ten &quot;capps.&quot;
Hats were also made of cloth. In the tailor's bill of work done for
Jonathan Corwin of Salem, in 1679, we read &quot;To making a Broadcloth
Hatt 14s. To making 2 hatts &amp; 2 jackets for your two sonnes 19s.&quot;
In 1672 an association of Massachusetts hatters asked privileges and
protection from the colonial government to aid and encourage American
manufacture, but they were refused until they made better hats. Shortly
after, however, the exportation of raccoon fur to England was forbidden, or
taxed, as it was found to be useful in the home manufacture of hats.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century saw many and varied forms of the cocked hat; the
nineteenth returned to a straight crown and brim. The description of these
will be given in the due course of the narrative of this book.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE VENERABLE HOOD</h3>
<p style='text-indent: 0em'> <img src="images\initialw.png" align=left
alt="W">e are told by the great Viollet le Duc that the faces of
fifteenth-century women were of a uniform type. Certainly a uniform
head-dress tends to establish a seeming resemblance of the wearers; the
strange, steeple head-dress of that century might well have that effect;
and the &quot;French hood&quot; worn so many years by English, French, and
American women has somewhat the same effect on women's countenances; it
gives a uniformity of severity. It is difficult for a face to be pretty and
gay under this gloomy hood. This French hood is plainly a development of
the head-rail, which was simply an unshaped oblong strip of linen or stuff
thrown over the head, and with the ends twisted lightly round the neck or
tied loosely under the chin with whatever grace or elegance the individual
wearer possessed.</p>

<p>Varying slightly from reign to reign, yet never greatly changed, this
sombre plain French hood was worn literally for centuries. It was deemed so
grave and dignified a head-covering that, in the reign of Edward III, women
of ill carriage were forbidden the wearing of it.</p>

<br><br>

<p>In the year 1472 &quot;Raye Hoods,&quot; that is, striped hoods, were
enjoined in several English towns as the distinctive wear of women of ill
character. And in France this black hood was under restriction; only ladies
of the French court were permitted to wear velvet hoods, and only women of
station and dignity, black hoods.</p>

<p>This black hood was dignified in allegorical literature as &quot;the
venerable hood,&quot; and was ever chosen by limners to cover the head of
any woman of age or dignity who was to be depicted.</p>

<p>In the <i>Ladies' Dictionary</i> a hood is defined thus: &quot;A Dutch
attire covering the head, face and all the body.&quot; And the long cloak
with this draped hood, which must have been much like the Shaker cloak of
to-day, seems to have been deemed a Dutch garment. It was warm and
comfortable enough to be adopted readily by the English Pilgrims in
Holland. It had come to England, however, in an earlier century. Of Ellinor
Rummin, the alewife, Skelton wrote about the year 1500:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;A Hake of Lincoln greene<br>
It had been hers I weene<br>
More than fortye yeare<br>
And soe it doth appeare<br>
And the green bare threds<br>
Looked like sere wedes<br>
Withered like hay<br>
The wool worn awaye<br>
And yet I dare saye<br>
She thinketh herself gaye<br>
Upon a holy day.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>It is impossible to know how old this hood is. When I have fancied I had
the earliest reference that could be found, I would soon come to another a
few years earlier. We know positively from the <i>Lisle Papers</i> that it
was worn in England by the name &quot;French hood&quot; in 1540. Anne
Basset, daughter of Lady Lisle, had come into the household of the queen of
Henry VIII, who at the time was Anne of Cleves. The &quot;French
Apparell&quot; which the maid of honor fetched from Calais was not pleasing
to the queen, who promptly ordered the young girl to wear &quot;a velvet
bonnet with a frontlet and edge of pearls.&quot; These bonnets are familiar
to us on the head of Anne's predecessor, Anne Boleyn. They were worn even
by young children. One is shown <a href="#Lady_Anne_Clifford.">here</a>.
The young lady borrowed a bonnet; and a factor named Husee--the biggest
gossip of his day--promptly chronicles to her mother, &quot;I saw her (Anne
Basset) yesterday in her velvet bonnet that my Lady Sussex had tired her
in, and thought it became her nothing so well as the French hood,--but the
Queen's pleasure must be done!&quot;</p>

<br><br>

<p>Doubtless some of the Pilgrim Mothers wore bonnets like this one of Anne
Basset's, especially if the wearer were a widow, when there was also an
under frontlet which was either plain, plaited, or folded, but which came
in a distinct point in the middle of the forehead.</p>

<p>This cap, or bandeau, with point on the forehead, is precisely the
widow's cap worn by Catherine de Medicis. She was very severe in dress, but
she introduced the wearing of neck-ruffs. She also wore hoods, the favorite
head-covering of all Frenchwomen at that time. This form of head-gear was
sometimes called a widow's peak, on account of a similar peak of black silk
or white being often worn by widows, apparently of all European nations.
Magdalen Beeckman, an American woman of Dutch descent (<a
href="#Mrs._Magdalen_Beekman.">here</a>), wears one. The name is still
applied to a pointed growth of hair on the forehead. It has also been known
as a headdress of Mary Queen of Scots, because some of her portraits
display this pointed outline of head-gear. It continued until the time of
Charles II. It is often found on church brasses, and was plainly a
head-gear of dignity. A modified form is shown in the portrait of Lady Mary
Armine.</p>

<p>Stubbes in his <i>Anatomie of Abuses</i> gives a notion of the
importance of the French hood when he speaks of the straining of all
classes for rich attire: that &quot;every artificer's wife&quot; will not
go without her hat of velvet every day; &quot;every merchant's wife and
meane gentlewoman&quot; must be in her &quot;French hood&quot;; and
&quot;every poor man's daughter&quot; in her &quot;taffatie hat or of wool
at least.&quot; We have seen what a fierce controversy burned over Madam
Johnson's &quot;schowish&quot; velvet hood.</p>

<p>An excellent account of this black hood as worn by the Puritans is given
in rhyme in &quot;Hudibras <i>Redivivus</i>,&quot; a long poem utterly
worthless save for the truthful descriptions of dress; it runs:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The black silk Hood, with formal pride<br>
First roll'd, beneath the chin was tied<br>
So close, so very trim and neat,<br>
So round, so formal, so complete,<br>
That not one jag of wicked lace<br>
Or rag of linnen white had place<br>
Betwixt the black bag and the face,<br>
Which peep'd from out the sable hood<br>
Like Luna from a sullen cloud.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>It was doubtless selected by the women followers of Fox on account of
its ancient record of sobriety and sanctity.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Are the pinch'd cap and formal hood the emblems of
sanctity? Does your virtue consist in your dress, Mrs.
Prim?&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>writes Mrs. Centlivre in <i>A Bold Stroke for a Wife</i>.</p>

<p>The black hood was worn long by Quaker women ere they adopted the beaver
hat of the eighteenth century, and the poke-bonnet of the nineteenth
century. <a href="#Hannah_Callowhill_Penn.">Here</a> is given a portrait of
Hannah Callowhill Penn, a Quaker, the second wife of William Penn. She was
a sensible woman brought up in a home where British mercantile thrift vied
with Quaker belief in adherence to sober attire, and her portrait plainly
shows her character. Penn's young and pretty wife of his youth wears a
fashionable pocket-hoop and rich brocade dress; but she wears likewise the
simple black hood (<a href="#Gulielma_Penn.">here</a>).</p>

<p>The dominance of this black French hood came not, however, through its
wear by sober-faced, discreet English Puritans and Quakers, but through a
French influence, a court influence, the earnestness of its adoption by
Madame de Maintenon, wife of King Louis XIV of France. The whole dress of
this strange ascetic would by preference have been that of a penitent; but
the king had a dislike of anything like mourning, so she wore dresses of
some dark color other than black, generally a dull brown. The conventual
aspect of her attire was added to by this large black hood, which was her
constant wear, and is seen in her portraits. The life at court became
melancholy, dejected, filled with icy reserve. And Madame, whether she rode
&quot;shut up in a close chair,&quot; says Duclos, &quot;to avoid the least
breath of air, while the King walked by her side, taking off his hat each
time he stopped to speak to her&quot;; or when she attended services in the
chapel, sitting in a closed gallery; or even in her own sombre apartments,
bending in silence over ecclesiastic needlework,--everywhere, her narrow,
yellow, livid face was shadowed and buried in this black hood.</p>

<p>Her strange power over the king was in force in 1681, and, until his
death in 1715, this sable hood, so unlike the French taste, covered the
heads of French women of all ages and ranks. The genial, almost quizzical
countenance of that noble and charitable woman, Madame de Miramion, wears a
like hood.</p>

<p>This French hood is prominent everywhere in book illustrations of the
eighteenth century and even of earlier years. The loosely tied corners and
the sides appear under the straw hats upon many of the figures in Tempest's
<i>Cryes of London</i>, 1698, such as the Milk woman, the &quot;Newes&quot;
woman, etc., which publication, I may say in passing, is a wonderful source
for the student of everyday costume. I give the Strawberry Girl on this
page to show the ordinary form of the French hood on plain folk.
<i>Misson's Memories</i>, published also in 1698, it gives the milkmaids on
Mayday in like hoods. The early editions of Hudibras show these hoods, and
in Hogarth's works they may be seen; not always of black, of course, in
later years, but ever of the same shape.</p>

<p>The hood worn by the Normans was called a chaperon. It was a sort of
pointed bag with an oval opening for the face; sometimes the point was of
great length, and was twisted, folded, knotted. In the Bodleian Library is
a drawing of eleven figures of young lads and girls playing
<i>Hoodman-blind</i> or <i>Blindman's-buff</i>. The latter name came from
the buffet or blow which the players gave with their twisted chaperon
hoods. The blind man simply put his hood on &quot;hind side afore,&quot;
and was effectually blinded. These figures are of the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p>The wild latitude of spelling often makes it difficult to define an
article of dress. I have before me a letter of the year 1704, written in
Boston, asking that a riding-hood be sent from England of any color save
yellow; and one sentence of the instructions reads thus, &quot;If 'tis
velvet let it be a shabbaroon; if of cloth, a French hood.&quot; I
abandoned &quot;shabbaroon&quot; as a wholly lost word; until Mrs. Gummere
announced that the word was chaperon, from the Norman hood just described.
This chaperon is specifically the hood worn by the Knights of the Garter
when in full dress; in general it applies to any ample hood which
completely covers head and face save for eye-holes. Another hood was the
sortie.</p>

<p>The term &quot;coif,&quot; spelt in various ways, quoif, quoiffe,
coiffer, ciffer, quoiffer, has been held to apply to the French hood; but
it certainly did not in America, for I find often in inventories side by
side items of black silk hoods and another of quoifs, which I believe were
the white undercaps worn with the French hood; just as a coif was the close
undercap for men's wear.</p>

<p>Through the two centuries following the assumption of the French hood
came a troop of hoods, though sometimes under other names. In 1664 Pepys
tells of his wife's yellow bird's-eye hood, &quot;very fine, to church, as
the fashion now is.&quot; Planch&eacute; says hoods were not displaced by
caps and bonnets till George II's time.</p>

<p>In the list of the &quot;wedding apparell&quot; of Madam Phillips, of
Boston, are velvet hoods, love-hoods, and &quot;sneal hoods&quot;; hoods of
Persian, of lustring, of gauze; frequently scarlet hoods are named. In 1712
Richard Hall sent, from Barbadoes to Boston, a trunk of his deceased wife's
finery to be sold, among which was &quot;one black Flowered Gauze
Hoode,&quot; and he added rather spitefully that he &quot;could send better
but it would be too rich for Boston.&quot; He was a grandson of Madam
Symonds of Ipswich. Furbelowed gauze hoods were then owned by Boston women,
and must have been pretty things. Their delicacy has kept them from being
preserved as have been velvet and Persian hoods.</p>

<p>For the years 1673 to 1721 we have a personal record of domestic life in
Boston, a diary which is the sole storehouse to which we can turn for
intimate knowledge of daily deeds in that little town. A scant record it
is, as to wearing apparel; for the diary-writer, Samuel Sewall, sometime
business man, friend, neighbor, councillor, judge,--and always
Puritan,--had not a regard of dress as had his English contemporary, the
gay Samuel Pepys, or even that sober English gentleman, John Evelyn. In
Pepys's pages we have frequent and light-giving entries as to dress,
interested and interesting entries. In Judge Sewall's diary, any references
to dress are wholly accidental and not related as matters of any moment,
save one important exception, his attitude toward wigs and wig-wearing. I
could wish Sewall had had a keener eye for dress, for he wrote in strong,
well-ordered English; and when he was deeply moved he wrote with much color
in his pen. The most spirited episodes in the book are the judge's
remarkable and varied courtships after he was left a widower at the age of
sixty-five, and again when sixty-eight. While thus courting he makes almost
his sole reference to women's dress,--that Madam Mico when he called came
to him in a splendid dress, and that Madam Winthrop's dress, <i>after she
had refused him</i>, was &quot;not so clean as sometime it had been.&quot;
But an article of his own dress, nevertheless, formed an important factor
in his unsuccessful courtship of Madam Winthrop--his hood. When all the
other widowers of the community, dignified magistrates, parsons, and men of
professions, all bourgeoned out in stately full-bottomed wigs, what woman
would want to have a lover who came a-courting in a hood? A detachable hood
with a cloak, I doubt not he wore, like the one owned by Judge Curwen, his
associate in that terrible tale of Salem's bigotry, cruelty, and credulity,
the Witchcraft Trial. I cannot fancy Judge Sewall in a scarlet cloak and
hood--a sad-colored one seems more in keeping with his temperament.</p>

<p>Perhaps our old friend, the judge, wore his hood under his hat, as did
the sober citizens in Piers Plowman; and as did judges in England.</p>

<p>It is certain that many men wore hoods; and they wore occasionally a
garment which was really woman's wear, namely, a &quot;riding hood&quot;;
which was also called a Dutch hood, and was like Elinor Rummin's hake. This
riding-hood was really more of a cloak than a head-covering, as it often
had arm-holes. It might well be classed with cloaks. I may say here that it
is not possible, either by years or by topics, to isolate completely each
chapter of this book from the other. Its very arrangement, being both by
chronology and subject, gives me considerable liberty, which I now take in
this chapter, by retaining the riding-hood among hoods, simply because of
its name.</p>

<p>On May 6, 1717, the <i>Boston News Letter</i> gave a description of a
gayly attired Indian runaway; she wore off a &quot;red Camblet Ryding Hood
fac'd with blue.&quot; Another servant absconded with an orange-colored
riding-hood with arm-holes. I have an ancient pattern of a riding-hood; it
was found in the bottom of an old hair-covered trunk. It was marked
&quot;London Ryding Hood.&quot; With it were rolled several packages of
bits of woollen stuff, one of scarlet broadcloth, one of blue camlet,
plainly labelled &quot;Cuttings from Apphia's ryding hood&quot; and
&quot;Pieces from Mary's ryding hood,&quot; showing that they had been
placed there with the pattern when the hood was cut. It is a cape, cut in a
deep point in front and back; the extreme length of the points from the
collar being about twenty-six inches. The hood is precisely like the one on
Judge Curwen's cloak, like the hoods of Shaker cloaks. As bits of silk are
rolled with the wool pieces, I infer that these riding-hoods were silk
lined.</p>

<p>A most romantic name was given to the riding-hood after the battle of
Preston in 1715. The Earl of Nithsdale, after the defeat of the Jacobites,
was imprisoned in the Tower of London under sentence of death. From thence
he made his escape through his wife's coolness and ingenuity. She visited
him dressed in a large riding-hood which could be drawn closely over her
face. He escaped in her dress and hood, fled to the continent, and lived
thirty years in safety in France. After that dashing rescue, these hoods
were known as Nithsdales. The head-covering portion still resembled the
French hood, but the shoulder-covering portion was circular and
ruffled--according to Hogarth. In Durfey's <i>Wit and Mirth</i>, 1719, is a
spirited song commemorating this &quot;sacred wife,&quot; who--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;by her Wits immortal pains<br>
With her quick head has saved his brains.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>One verse runs thus:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Let Traitors against Kings conspire<br> Let secret spies
great Statesmen hire,<br> Nought shall be by detection got<br> If Woman may
have leave to plot.<br> There's nothing clos'd with Bars or Locks<br> Can
hinder Night-rayls, Pinners, Smocks;<br> For they will everywhere make
good<br> As now they've done the Riding-hood.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>In 1737 &quot;pug hoods&quot; were in fashion. We have no proof of their
shape, though I am told they were the close, plain, silk hood sometimes
worn under other hoods. One is shown <a href="#Pug_Hood.">here</a>. Pumpkin
hoods of thickly wadded wool were prodigiously hot head-coverings; they
were crudely pumpkin shaped. Knitted hoods, under such names as
&quot;comforters,&quot; &quot;fascinators,&quot; &quot;rigolettes,&quot;
&quot;nubias,&quot; &quot;opera hoods,&quot; &quot;molly hoods,&quot; are
of nineteenth-century invention.</p>

<br>

<h3>CLOAKS AND THEIR COUSINS</h3>
<p style='text-indent: 0em'> <img src="images\initialu.png" align=left
alt="U">nder the general heading of cloaks I intend to write of the various
capelike shoulder-coverings, for both men and women, which were worn in the
two centuries of costume whereof this book treats. Often it is impossible
to determine whether a garment should be classed as a hood or a cloak, for
so many cloaks were made with head-coverings. Both capuchins and cardinals,
garments of popularity for over a century, had hoods, and were worn as
head-gear.</p>

<p>There is shown <a href="#Scarlet_Broadcloth_Hooded_Cloak.">here</a> a
full, long cloak of rich scarlet broadcloth, which is the oldest cloak I
know. It has an interesting and romantic history. No relic in Salem is more
noteworthy than this. It has survived since witchcraft days; and with right
care, care such as it receives from its present owner, will last a thousand
years. It was worn by Judge Curwen, one of the judges in those dark hours
for Salem; and is still owned by Miss Bessie Curwen, his descendant. It
will be noted that it bears a close resemblance to the Shaker cloaks of
to-day, though the hood is handsomer. This hood also is detached from the
cape. The presiding justice in the Salem witchcraft trials was William
Stoughton, a severe Puritan. In later years Judge Sewall, his fellow-judge,
in an agony of contrition, remorse, self-reproach, self-abnegation, and
exceeding sorrow at those judicial murders, stood in Boston meeting-house,
at a Sabbath service while his pastor read aloud his confession of his
cruel error, his expression of his remorse therefor. A striking figure is
he in our history. No thoughtful person can regard without emotions of
tenderest sympathy and admiration that benignant white-haired head, with
black skullcap, bowed in public disgrace, which was really his honor. But
Judge Stoughton never expressed, in public or private, remorse or even
regret. I doubt if he ever felt either. He plainly deemed his action right.
I wish he could tell us what he thinks of it now. In his portrait here he
wears a skullcap, as does Judge Sewall in his portrait, and a cloak with a
cape like that of his third associate, Judge Curwen. Judge Sewall had both
cloak and hood. Possibly all judges wore them. Judge Stoughton's cloak has
a rich collar and a curious clasp.</p>

<p>Stubbes of course told of the fashion of cloak-wearing:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;They have clokes also in nothing discrepant from the
rest; of dyverse and sundry colours, white red tawnie black, green yellow
russet purple violet and an infinyte of other colours. Some of cloth silk
velvet taffetie and such like; some of the Spanish French or Dutch
fashion. Some short, scarcely reaching to the gyrdlestead or waist, some
to the knee, and othersome trayling upon the ground almost like gownes
than clokes. These clokes must be garded laced &amp; thorouly full, and
sometimes so lined as the inner side standeth almost in as much as the
outside. Some have sleeves, othersome have none. Some have hoodes to pull
over the head, some have none. Some are hanged with points and tassels of
gold silver silk, some without all this. But howsoever it bee, the day
hath bene when one might have bought him two Clokes for lesse than now he
can have one of these Clokes made for. They have such store of workmanship
bestowed upon them.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>It is such descriptions as this that make me regard in admiration this
ancient Puritan. Would that I had the power of his pen! Fashion-plates,
forsooth! The <i>Journal of the Modes</i>!--pray, what need have we of any
pictures or any mantua-maker's words when we can have such a description as
this. Why! the man had a perfect genius for millinery! Had he lived three
centuries later, we might have had Master Stubbes in full control (openly
or secretly, according to his environment) of some dress-making or
tailoring establishment <i>pour les dames</i>.</p>

<p>The lining of these cloaks was often very gay in color and costly;
&quot;standing in as much as the outside.&quot; We find a son of Governor
Winthrop writing in 1606:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I desire you to bring me a very good camlet cloake lyned
with what you like except blew. It may be purple or red or striped with
those or other colors if so worn suitable and fashionable.... I would
make a hard shift rather than not have the cloak.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Similar cloaks of scarlet, and of blue lined with scarlet, formed part
of the uniform of soldiers for many years and for many nations. They were
certainly the wear of thrifty comfortable English gentlemen. Did not John
Gilpin wear one on his famous ride?</p>

<blockquote>&quot;There was all that he might be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipped from head to toe,<br>
His long red cloak well-brushed and neat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He manfully did throw.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Scarlet was a most popular color for all articles of dress in the early
years of the eighteenth century. Like the good woman in the Book of
Proverbs, both English and American housewife &quot;clothed her household
in scarlet.&quot; Women as well as men wore these scarlet cloaks. It is
curious to learn from Mrs. Gummere that even Quakers wore scarlet. When
Margaret Fell married George Fox, greatest of Quakers, he bought her a
scarlet mantle. And in 1678 he sent her scarlet cloth for another mantle.
There was good reason in the wear of scarlet; it both was warm and looked
warm; and the color was a lasting one. It did not fade like many of the
homemade dyes.</p>

<p>A very interesting study is that of color in wearing apparel. Beginning
with the few crude dyes of mediaeval days, we could trace the history of
dyeing, and the use and invention of new colors and tints. The names of
these colors are delightful; the older quaint titles seem wonderfully
significant. We read of such tints as billymot, phillymurt, or philomot
(feuille-mort), murry, blemmish, gridolin (gris-de-lin or flax blossom),
puce colour, foulding colour, Kendal green, Lincoln green, treen-colour,
watchet blue, barry, milly, tuly, stammel red, Bristol red, zaffer-blue,
which was either sapphire-blue or zaffre-blue, and a score of fanciful
names whose signification and identification were lost with the death of
the century. Historical events were commemorated in new hues; we have the
political, diplomatic, and military history of various countries hinted to
us. Great discoveries and inventions give names to colors. The materials
and methods of dyeing, especially domestic dyes, are most interesting. An
allied topic is the significance of colors, the limitation of their use.
For instance, the study of blue would fill a chapter. The dress of
'prentices and serving-men in Elizabeth's day was always blue blue cloaks
in winter, blue coats in summer. Blue was not precisely a livery; it was
their color, the badge of their condition in life, as black is now a
parson's. Different articles of dress clung to certain colors. Green
stockings had their time and season of clothing the sturdy legs of English
dames as inevitably as green stalks filled the fields. Think of the years
of domination of the green apron; of the black hood--it is curious
indeed.</p>

<p>In such exhaustive books upon special topics as the <i>History of the
Twelve Great Livery Companies of London</i> we find wonderfully interesting
and significant proof of the power of color; also in many the restrictive
sumptuary laws of the Crown.</p>

<p>It would appear that this long, scarlet cloak never was out of wear for
men and women until the nineteenth century. It was, at times, not the
height of the fashion, but still was worn. Various ancient citizens of
Boston, of Salem, are recalled through letter or traditions as clinging
long to this comfortable cloak. Samuel Adams carried a scarlet cloak with
him when he went to Washington.</p>

<p>I shall tell in a later chapter of my own great-great-grandmother's wear
of a scarlet cloak until the opening years of the nineteenth century.
During and after the Revolution these cloaks remained in high favor for
women. French officers, writing home to France glowing accounts of the fair
Americans, noted often that the ladies wore scarlet cloaks, and Madame
Riedesel asserted that all gentlewomen in Canada never left the house save
in a scarlet silk or cloth cloak.</p>

<p>&quot;A woman's long scarlet cloak, almost new with a double cape,&quot;
had been one of the articles feloniously taken from the house of Benjamin
Franklin, printer, in Philadelphia, in 1750. Debby Franklin's dress, if we
can judge from what was stolen, was a gay revel of color. Among the
articles was one gown having a pattern of &quot;large red roses and other
large yellow flowers with blue in some of the flowers with many green
leaves.&quot;</p>

<p>In the <i>Life of Jonathan Trumbull</i> we read that when a collection
was taken in the Lebanon church for the benefit of the soldiers of the
Continental army, when money, jewels, clothing, and food were gathered in a
great heap near the pulpit, Madam Faith Trumbull rose up, threw from her
shoulders her splendid scarlet cloth cloak, a gift from Count Rochambeau,
advanced to the altar and laid the cloak with other offerings of patriotism
and generosity. It was used, we are told, to trim the uniforms of the
Continental officers and soldiers.</p>

<p>One of the first entries in regard to dress made by Philip Fithian in
1773, when he went to Virginia as a school-teacher, was that &quot;almost
every Lady wears a Red Cloak; and when they ride out they tye a Red
Handkerchief over their Head &amp; Face; so when I first came to Virginia,
I was distrest whenever I saw a Lady, for I thought she had the
Tooth-Ach!&quot; When the young tutor left his charge a year later, he
wrote a long letter of introduction, instruction, and advice to his
successor; and so much impression had this riding-dress still upon him that
he recounted at length the &quot;Masked Ladies,&quot; as he calls them,
explaining that the whole neck and face was covered, save a narrow slit for
the eyes, as if they had &quot;the Mumps or Tooth-Ach.&quot; It is possible
that the insect torments encountered by the fair riders may have been the
reason for this cloaking and masking. Not only mosquitoes and flies and
fleas were abundant, but Fithian tells of the irritating illness and high
fever of the fairest of his little flock from being bitten with ticks,
&quot;which cover her like a distinct smallpox.&quot;</p>

<p>In seventeenth-century inventories an occasional item is a rocket. I
think no better description of a rocket can be given than that of Celia
Fiennes:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;You meete all sorts of countrywomen wrapped up in the
mantles called West Country Rockets, a large mantle doubled together, of a
sort of serge, some are linsey-woolsey and a deep fringe or fag at the
lower end; these hang down, some to their feet, some only just below the
waist; in the summer they are all in white garments of this sort, in the
winter they are in red ones.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>This would seem much like a blanket shawl, but the word was also applied
to the scarlet round cloak.</p>

<p>Another much-used name and cloaklike garment was the roquelaure. A very
good contemporary definition may be copied from <i>A Treatise on the
Modes</i>, 1715; it says it is &quot;a short abridgement or compendium of a
coat which is dedicated to the Duke of Roquelaure.&quot; It was simply a
shorter cloak than had been worn, and it was hoodless; for the great curled
wigs with heavy locks well over the shoulders made hoods superfluous; and
even impossible, for men's wear. It was very speedily taken into favor by
women; and soon the advertisements of lost articles show that it was worn
by women universally as by men. In the <i>Boston News Letter</i>, in 1730,
a citizen advertises that he has lost his &quot;Blue Cloak or Roculo with
brass buttons.&quot; This was the first of an ingenious series of
misspellings which produced at times a word almost unrelated to the
original French word. Rocklow, rockolet, roquelo, rochelo, roquello, and
even rotkello have I found. Ashton says that scarlet cloth was the favorite
fabric for roquelaures in England; and he deems the scarlet roclows and
rocliers with gold loops and buttons &quot;exceeding magnifical.&quot; I
note in the American advertisements that the lost roquelaures are of very
bright colors; some were of silk, some of camlet; generally they are simply
'cloth.' Many of the American roquelaures had double capes. I think those
handsome, gay cloaks must have given a very bright, cheerful aspect to the
town streets of the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Sir William Pepperell, who was ever a little shaky in his spelling, but
possibly no more so than his neighbors, sent in 1737 from Piscataqua to one
Hooper in England for &quot;A Handsom Rockolet for my daughter of about 15
yrs. old, or what is ye Most Newest Fashion for one of her age to ware at
meeting in ye Winter Season.&quot;</p>

<p>The capuchin was a hooded cloak named from the hooded garment worn by
the Capuchin monks. The date 1752 given by Fairholt as an early date of its
wear is far wrong. Fielding used the word in <i>Tom Jones</i> in 1749;
other English publications, in 1709; and I find it in the <i>Letters of
Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;</i> as early as 1686. The cardinal, worn at
the same date, was originally of scarlet cloth, and I find was generally of
some wool stuff. At one time I felt sure that cardinal was always the name
for the woollen cloak, and capuchin of the silken one; but now I am a bit
uncertain whether this is a rule. Judging from references in literature and
advertisements, the capuchin was a richer garment than the cardinal.
Capuchins were frequently trimmed liberally with lace, ribbons, and
robings; were made of silk with gauze ruffles, or of figured velvet. One is
here shown which is taken from one of Hogarth's prints.</p>

<p>This notice is from the <i>Boston Evening Post</i> of January 13,
1772:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Taken from Concert Hall on Thursday Evening a handsom
Crimson Satin Capuchin trimmed with a rich white Blond Lace with a narrow
Blond Lace on the upper edge Lined with White
Sarsnet.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>In 1752 capuchins and cardinals were much worn, especially purple ones.
The <i>Connoisseur</i> says all colors were neglected for purple. &quot;In
purple we glowed from hat to shoe. In such request were ribbons and silks
of that famous color that neither milliner mercer nor dyer could meet the
demand.&quot;</p>

<p>The names &quot;cardinal&quot; and &quot;capuchin&quot; had been derived
from monkish wear, and the cape, called a pelerine, had an allied
derivation; it is said to be derived from <i>p&egrave;lerin</i>--meaning a
pilgrim. It was a small cape with longer ends hanging in front; and was
invented as a light, easily adjustable covering for the ladies' necks,
which had been left so widely and coldly bare by the low-cut French
bodices. It is said that the garment was invented in France in 1671. I do
not find the word in use in America till 1730. Then mantua-makers
advertised that they would make them. Various materials were used, from
soft silk and thin cloth to rich velvet; but silk pelerines were more
common.</p>

<p>In 1743, in the <i>Boston News Letter</i>, Henrietta Maria East
advertised that &quot;Ladies may have their Pellerines made&quot; at her
mantua-making shop. In 1749 &quot;pellerines&quot; were advertised for sale
in the <i>Boston Gazette</i> and a black velvet &quot;pellerine&quot; was
lost.</p>

<p>In the quotation heading this chapter, manteel, pelerine, and neckatee
precede the capuchin; but in fact the capuchin is as old as the pelerine.
Beyond the fact that all mantua-makers made neckatees, and that they were a
small cape, this garment cannot be described. It required much less stuff
than either capuchin or cardinal. The &quot;manteel&quot; was, of course,
as old as the cloak. Elijah &quot;took his mantle and wrapped it together,
and smote the waters.&quot; In the Middle Ages the mantle was a great piece
of cloth in any cloaklike shape, of which the upper corners were fastened
at the neck. Often one of the front edges was thrown over one shoulder. In
the varied forms of spelling and wearing, as manto, manteau, mantoon,
mantelet, and mantilla the foundation is the same. We have noted the
richness and elegance of Madam Symonds's mantua. We could not forget the
word and its signification while we have so important a use of it in
mantua-maker.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Dauphiness was the name of a certain style of mantle, which was most
popular about 1750. Harriot Paine had &quot;Dauphiness Mantles&quot; for
sale in Boston in 1755. A rude drawing in an old letter indicates that the
&quot;Dauphiness&quot; had a deep point at the back, and was cut up high at
the arm-hole. It was of thin silk, and was trimmed all around the lower
edge with a deep, full frill of the silk, which at the arm-hole fell over
the arm like a short sleeve.</p>

<p>Many were the names of those pretty little cloaks and capes which were
worn with the sacque-shaped gowns. The duchess was one; we revived the name
for a similar mantle in 1870. The pelisse was in France the cloak with
arm-holes, shown, <a href="#Lady_Caroline_Montagu.">here</a>, upon one of
Sir Joshua Reynolds's engaging children. The pelisse in America sometimes
had sleeves, I am sure; and was hardly a cloak. It is difficult to classify
some forms which seem almost jackets. A general distinction may be made not
to include sleeved garments with the cloaks; but several of the manteaus
had loose, large, flowing sleeves, and some like Madam Symonds's had
detached sleeves. It is also difficult to know whether some of the
negligees were cloaks or sacque-like gowns. And there is the other extreme;
some of the smaller, circular neck-coverings like the van-dykes are not
cloaks. They are scarcely capes; they are merely collars; but there are
still others which are a bit bigger and are certainly capes. And are there
not also capes, like the neckatee, which may be termed cloaks? Material,
too, is bewildering; a light gauze thing of ribbons and furbelows like the
Unella is not really a cloak, yet it takes a cloaklike form. There are no
cut and dried rules as to size, form, or weight of these cloaks, capes,
collars, and hoods, so I have formed my own classes and assignments.</p>

<h3>THE DRESS OF OLD-TIME CHILDREN</h3>
<p style='text-indent: 0em'> <img src="images\initialw.png" align=left
alt="W">hen we reflect that in any community the number of &quot;the
younger sort&quot; is far larger than of grown folk, when we know, too,
what large families our ancestors had, in all the colonies, we must deem
any picture of social life, any history of costume, incomplete unless the
dress of children is shown. French and English books upon costume are
curiously silent regarding such dress. It might be alleged as a reason for
this singular silence that the dress of young children was for centuries
precisely that of their elders, and needed no specification. But infants'
dress certainly was widely different, and full of historic interest, as
well as quaint prettiness; and there were certain details of the dress of
older children that were most curious and were wholly unlike the
contemporary garb of their elders; sometimes these details were survivals
of ancient modes for grown folk, sometimes their name was a survival while
their form had changed.</p>

<p>For the dress of children of the early years of colonial life--the
seventeenth century--I have an unusual group of five portraits. One is the
little Padishal child, shown with her mother in the frontispiece, one is
Robert Gibbes (shown <a href="#Robert_Gibbes.">here</a>). The third child
is said to be John Quincy--his picture is opposite this page. The two
portraits of Margaret and Henry Gibbes are owned in Virginia; but are too
dimly photographed for reproduction. The portrait of Robert Gibbes is owned
by inheritance by Miss Sarah B. Hager, of Kendal Green, Massachusetts. It
is well preserved, having hung for over a hundred years on the same wall in
the old house. He was four years old when this portrait was painted. It is
marked 1670. John Quincy's portrait is marked also plainly as one and a
half years old, and with a date which is a bit dimmed; it is either 1670 or
1690. If it is 1690, the picture can be that of John Quincy, though he
would scarcely be as large as is the portrayed figure. If the date is 1670,
it cannot be John Quincy, for he was born in 1689. The picture has the same
checker-board floor as the three other Gibbes portraits, four rows of
squares wide; and the child's toes are set at the same row as are the toes
of the shoes in the picture of Robert Gibbes.</p>

<p>The portraits of Henry and Margaret Gibbes are also marked plainly 1670.
There was a fourth Gibbes child, who would have been just the age of the
subject of the Quincy portrait; and it is natural that there should be a
suspicion that this fourth portrait is of the fourth Gibbes child, not of
John Quincy.</p>

<p>Margaret Gibbes was born in 1663. Henry Gibbes was born in 1667. He
became a Congregational minister. His daughter married Nathaniel Appleton,
and through Nathaniel, John, Dr. John S., and John, the portrait, with that
of Margaret, came to the present owner, General John W. S. Appleton, of
Charlestown, West Virginia.</p>

<p>The dress of these five children is of the same rich materials that
would be worn by their mothers. The Padishal child wears black velvet like
her mother's gown; but her frock is brightened with scarlet points of
color. The linings of the velvet hanging sleeves, the ribbon knots of the
white virago-sleeve, the shoe-tip, the curious cap-tassel, are of bright
scarlet. We have noted the dominance of scarlet in old English costumes. It
was evidently the only color favored for children. The lace cap, the rich
lace stomacher, the lace-edged apron, all are of Flemish lace. Margaret
Gibbes wears a frock of similar shape, and equally rich and dark in color;
it is a heavy brocade of blue and red, with a bit of yellow. Her fine
apron, stomacher, and full sleeves are rich in needlework. Robert Gibbes's
&quot;coat,&quot; as a boy's dress at that age then was called, is a
striking costume. The inmost sleeves are of white lawn, over them are
sleeves made of strips of galloon of a pattern in yellow, white, scarlet,
and black, with a rolled cuff of red velvet. There is a similar roll around
the hem of the coat. Still further sleeves are hanging sleeves of velvet
trimmed with the galloon.</p>

<p>It will be noted that his hanging sleeve is cut square and trimmed
squarely across the end. It is similar to the sleeves worn at the same time
by citizens of London in their formal &quot;liveryman's&quot; dress, which
had bands like pockets, that sometimes really were pockets.</p>

<p>His plain, white, hemstitched band would indicate that he was a boy, did
not the swing of his petticoats plainly serve to show it, as do also his
brothers' &quot;coats.&quot; That child knew well what it was to tread and
trip on those hated petticoats as he went upstairs. I know how he begged
for breeches. The apron of John Quincy varies slightly in shape from that
of the other boy, but the general dress is like, save his pretty, gay,
scarlet hood, worn over a white lace cap. One unique detail of these Gibbes
portraits, and the Quincy portrait, is the shoes. In all four, the shoes
are of buff leather, with absolutely square toes, with a thick, scarlet
sole to which the buff-leather upper seems tacked with a row either of
long, thick, white stitches or of heavy metal-headed nails; these white
dots are very ornamental. One pair of the shoes has great scarlet roses on
the instep. The square toe was distinctly a Cavalier fashion. It is in Miss
Campion's portrait, facing this page, and in the print of the Prince of
Orange <a href="#311">here</a>, and is found in many portraits of the day.
But these American shoes are in the minor details entirely unlike any
English shoes I have seen in any collection elsewhere, and are most
interesting. They were doubtless English in make.</p>

<p>The portrait of John Quincy resembles much in its dress that of Oliver
Cromwell when two years old, the picture now at Chequers Court. Cromwell's
linen collar is rounded, and a curious ornament is worn in front, as a
little girl would wear a locket. The whole throat and a little of the upper
neck is bare. Dark hair, slightly curled, comes out from the close cap in
front of the ears. This picture of Cromwell distinctly resembles his
mother's portrait.</p>

<br><br>

<p>The quaint tassel or rosette or feather on the cap of the Padishal child
was a fashion of the day. It is seen in many Dutch portraits of children.
In a curious old satirical print of Oliver Cromwell preaching are the
figures of two little children drawn standing by their mother's side. One
child's back is turned for our sight, and shows us what might well be the
back of the gown of the Padishal child. The cap has the same ornament on
the crown, and the hanging sleeves--of similar form--have, at intervals of
a few inches apart from shoulder to heel, an outside embellishment of knots
of ribbon. There is also a band or strip of embroidery or passementerie up
the back of the gown from skirt-hem to lace collar, with a row of buttons
on the strip. This proves that the dress was fastened in the back, as the
stiff, unbroken, white stomacher also indicates. The other child is
evidently a boy. His gown is long and fur-edged. His cap is round like a
Scotch bonnet, and has also a tuft or rosette at the crown. On either side
hang long strings or ribbon bands reaching from the cap edge to the
knee.</p>

<p>These portraits of these little American children display nothing of
that God-given attribute which we call genius, but they do possess a
certain welcome trait, which is truthfulness; a hard attention to detail,
which confers on them a quality of exactness of likeness of which we are
very sensible. We have for comparison a series of portraits of the same
dates, but of English children, the children of the royal and court
families. I give <a
href="#Duchess_of_Buckingham_and_her_Two_Children.">here</a> a part of the
portrait group of the family of the Duke of Buckingham; namely, the Duchess
of Buckingham and her two children, an infant son and a daughter, Mary. She
was a wonderful child, known in the court as &quot;Pretty Moll,&quot;
having the beauty of her father, the &quot;handsomest-bodied&quot; man in
court, his vivacity, his vigor, and his love of dancing, all of which made
him the prime favorite both of James and his son, Charles.</p>

<p>A letter exists written by the duchess to her husband while he was gone
to Spain with his thirty suits of richly embroidered garments of which I
have written in my first chapter. The duchess writes of &quot;Pretty
Moll,&quot; who was not a year old:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;She is very well, I thank God; and when she is set to her
feet and held by her sleeves she will not go softly but stamp, and set one
foot before another very fast, and I think she will run before she can go.
She loves dancing extremely; and when the Saraband is played, she will get
her thumb and finger together offering to snap; and then when &quot;Tom
Duff&quot; is sung, she will shake her apron; and when she hears the tune
of the clapping dance my Lady Frances Herbert taught the Prince, she will
clap both her hands together, and on her breast, and she can tell the tunes
as well as any of us can; and as they change tunes she will change her
dancing. I would you were here but to see her, for you would take much
delight in her now she is so full of pretty play and tricks. Everybody says
she grows each day more like you.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Can you not see the engaging little creature, clapping her hands and
trying to step out in a dance? No imaginary description could equal in
charm this bit of real life, this word-picture painted in bright and living
colors by a mother's love. I give another merry picture of her childhood
and widowhood in a later chapter. Many portraits of &quot;Pretty Moll&quot;
were painted by Van Dyck, more than of any woman in England save the queen.
One shows her in the few months that she was the child-wife of the eldest
son of the Earl of Pembroke. She is in the centre of the great family
group. She was married thrice; her favorite choice of character in which to
be painted was Saint Agnes, who died rather than be married at all.</p>

<p>Both mother and child in this picture wear a lace cap of unusual shape,
rather broader where turned over at the ear than at the top. It is seen on
a few other portraits of that date, and seems to have come to England with
the queen of James I. It disappeared before the graceful modes of
hair-dressing introduced by Queen Henrietta Maria.</p>

<p>The genius of Van Dyck has preserved for us a wonderful portraiture of
children of this period, the children of King Charles I. The earliest group
shows the king and queen with two children; one a baby in arms with long
clothes and close cap--this might have been painted yesterday. The little
prince standing at his father's knee is in a dark green frock, much like
John Quincy's, and apparently no richer. A painting at Windsor shows king
and queen with the two princes, Charles and James; another, also at
Windsor, gives the mother with the two sons. One at Turin gives the two
princes with their sister. At Windsor, and in <i>replica</i> at Berlin, is
the famous masterpiece with the five children, dated 1637.</p>

<p>This exquisite group shows Charles, the Prince of Wales (aged seven),
with his arm on the head of a great dog; he is in the full garb of a grown
man, a Cavalier. His suit is red satin; the shoes are white, with red
roses. Mary, demure as in all her portraits, is aged six; she wears
virago-sleeves made like those of Margaret Gibbes, with hanging sleeves
over them, a lace stomacher, and cap, with tufts of scarlet, and hair
curled lightly on the forehead, and pulled out at the side in ringlets,
like that of her mother, Henrietta Maria. The Duke of York, aged two, wears
a red dress spotted with yellow, with sleeves precisely like those of
Robert Gibbes; white lace-edged apron, stomacher, and cap; his hair is in
curls. The Princess Elizabeth was aged about two; she is in blue. Her cap
is of wrought and tucked lawn, and she wears either a pearl ear-ring or a
pearl pendant at the corner of the cap just at the ear, and a string of
pearls around her neck. She has a gentle, serious face, one with a
premonitory tinge of sadness. She was the favorite daughter of the king,
and wrote the inexpressibly touching account of his last days in prison.
She was but thirteen, and he said to her the day before his execution,
&quot;Sweetheart, you will forget all this.&quot; &quot;Not while I
live,&quot; she answered, with many tears, and promised to write it down.
She lived but a short time, for she was broken-hearted; she was found dead,
with her head lying on the religious book she had been reading--in which
attitude she is carved on her tomb. The baby is Princess Anne, a fat little
thing not a year old; she is naked, save for a close cap and a little
drapery. She died when three and a half years old; died with these words on
her lips, &quot;Lighten Thou mine eyes, O Lord, that I sleep not the sleep
of Death.&quot; It was not Puritan children only at that time who were
filled with deep religious thought, and gave expression to that thought
even in infancy; children of the Church of England and of the Roman
Catholic Church were all widely imbued with religious feeling, and Biblical
words were the familiar speech of the day, of both young and old. It rouses
in me strange emotions when I gaze at this portrait and remember all that
came into the lives of these royal children. They had been happier had they
been born, like the little Gibbes children, in America, and of untitled
parents.</p>

<h4>William, Prince of Orange.</h4>

<br><br>

<p>At Amsterdam may be seen the portrait of Princess Mary painted with her
cousin, William of Orange, who became her child-husband. She had the
happiest life of any of the five--if she ever could be happy after her
father's tragic death. In this later portrait she is a little older and
sadder and stiffer. Her waist is more pinched, her shoulders narrower, her
face more demure. His likeness is here given. The only marked difference in
the dress of these children from the dress of the Gibbes children is in the
lace; the royal family wear laces with deeply pointed edges, the point
known as a Vandyke. The American children wear straight-edged laces, as was
the general manner of laces of that day. An old print of the Duke of York
when about seven years old is given (<a
href="#JAMES_DUKE_OF_YORK">here</a>). He carries in his hand a quaint
racket.</p>

<p>The costume worn by these children is like that of plebeian English
children of the same date. A manuscript drawing of a child of the people in
the reign of Charles I shows a precisely similar dress, save that the child
is in leading-strings held by the mother; and in the belt to which the
leading-strings are attached is thrust a &quot;muckinder&quot; or
handkerchief.</p>

<p>These leading-strings are seldom used now, but they were for centuries a
factor in a child's progress. They were a favorite gift to children; and
might be a simple flat strip of strong stuff, or might be richly worked
like the leading-strings which Mary, Queen of Scots embroidered for her
little baby, James. These are three bands of Spanish pink satin ribbon,
each about four or five feet long and over an inch wide. The three are
sewed with minute over-and-over stitches into a flat band about four inches
wide, and are embroidered with initials, emblems of the crown, a verse of a
psalm, and a charming flower and grape design. The gold has tarnished into
brown, and the flower colors are fled; but it is still a beautiful piece of
work, speaking with no uncertain voice of a tender, loving mother and a
womanly queen. There were crewel-worked leading-strings in America. One is
prettily lined with strips of handsome brocade that had been the mother's
wedding petticoat; it is not an ill rival of the princely
leading-strings.</p>

<p>Another little English girl, who was not a princess, but who lived in
the years when ran and played our little American children, was Miss
Campion, who &quot;minded her horn-book&quot;--minded it so well that she
has been duly honored as the only English child ever painted with horn-book
in hand. Her petticoat and stomacher, her apron, and cap and hanging
sleeves and square-toed shoes are just like Margaret Gibbes's--bought in
the same London shops, very likely.</p>

<p>Not only did all these little English and American children dress alike,
but so did French children, and so did Spanish children--only little
Spanish girls had to wear hoops. Hoops were invented in Spain; and proud
was the Spanish queen of them.</p>

<p>Velasquez, contemporary with Van Dyck, painted the Infanta Maria
Theresa; the portrait is now in the Prado at Madrid. She carries a
handkerchief as big as a tablecloth; but above her enormous hoop appears
not only the familiar virago-sleeve, but the straight whisk or collar, just
like that of English children and dames. This child and the Princess
Marguerite, by Velasquez, have the hair parted on one side with the top
lock turned aside and tied with a knot of ribbon precisely as we tie our
little daughters' hair to-day; and as the bride of Charles II wore her hair
when he married her. French children had not assumed hoops. I have an old
French portrait before me of a little demoiselle, aged five, in a scarlet
cloth gown with edgings of a narrow gray gimp or silver lace. All the
sleeves, the slashes, the long, hanging sleeves are thus edged. She wears a
long, narrow, white lawn apron, and her stiff bodice has a stomacher of
lawn. There is a straight white collar tied with tiny bows in front and
white cuffs; a scarlet close cap edged with silver lace completes an
exquisite costume, which is in shape like that of Margaret Gibbes. The
garments of all these children, royal and subject, are too long, of course,
for comfort in walking; too stiff, likewise, for comfort in wearing; too
richly laced to be suitable for everyday wear; too costly, save for folk of
wealth; yet nevertheless so quaint, so becoming, so handsome, so rich, that
we reluctantly turn away from them.</p>

<p>The dress of all young children in families of estate was cumbersome to
a degree. There exists to-day a warrant for the purchase of clothing of
Mary Tudor, sister of Henry VIII, when she was a sportive, wilful, naughty
little child of four. She wore such unwieldy and ugly guise as this:
kirtles of tawny damask and black satin; gowns of green and crimson striped
velvet edged with purple tinsel, which must have been hideous. All were
lined with heavy black buckram. Indeed, the inner portions, the linings of
old-time garments, even of royalty, were far from elegant. I have seen
garments worn by grown princesses of the eighteenth century, whereof the
rich brocade bodies were lined with common, heavy fabric, usually a stiff
linen; and the sewing was done with thread as coarse as shoe-thread, often
homespun. This, too, when the sleeve and neck-ruffles would be of
needlework so exquisite that it could not be rivalled in execution
to-day.</p>

<p>Many of the older portraits of children show hanging sleeves. The rich
claret velvet dresses of the Van Cortlandt twins, aged four, had hanging
sleeves. This dress is given in my book, <i>Child Life in Colonial
Days</i>, as is that of Katherine Ten Broeck, another child of Dutch birth
living in New York, who also wore heavy hanging sleeves.</p>

<p>The use of the word hanging sleeves in common speech and in literature
is most interesting. It had a figurative meaning; it symbolized youth and
innocence. This meaning was acquired, of course, from the wear for
centuries of hanging sleeves by little children, both boys and girls. It
had a second, a derivative signification, being constantly employed as a
figure of speech to indicate second childhood; it was used with a wistful
tender meaning as an emblem of the helplessness of feeble old age. The
following example shows such an employment of the term.</p>

<p>In 1720, Judge Samuel Sewall, of Boston, then about seventy-five years
of age, wrote to another old gentleman, whose widowed sister he desired to
marry, in these words:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I remember when I was going from school at Newbury to
have sometime met your sisters Martha and Mary in Hanging Sleeves, coming
home from their school in Chandlers Lane, and have had the pleasure of
speaking to them. And I could find it in my heart now to speak to Mrs.
Martha again, now I myself am reduced to Hanging
Sleeves.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>William Byrd, of Westover, in Virginia, in one of his engaging and
sprightly letters written in 1732, pictures the time of the patriarchs when
&quot;a man was reckoned at Years of Discretion at 100; Boys went into
Breeches at about 40; Girles continued in Hanging Sleeves till 50, and
plaid with their Babys till Threescore.&quot;</p>

<p>When Benjamin Franklin was seven years old, he wrote a poem which was
sent to his uncle, a bright old Quaker. This uncle responded in clever
lines which begin thus:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;'Tis time for me to throw aside my pen<br>
When Hanging-Sleeves read, write and rhyme like men.<br>
This forward Spring foretells a plenteous crop<br>
For if the bud bear grain, what will the top?&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>A curious use of the long hanging sleeve was as a pocket; that is, it
would seem curious to us were it not for our acquaintance with the capacity
of the sleeves of our unwelcome friend, Ah Sing. The pocketing sleeve of
the time of Henry III still exists in the heraldic charge known as the
manche, borne by the Hastings and Norton family. This is also called
maunch, &eacute;manche, and mancheron. The word &quot;manchette,&quot; an
ornamented cuff, retains the meaning of the word, as does manacle; all are
from <i>manus</i>.</p>

<p>Hanging sleeves had a time of short popularity for grown folk while Anne
Boleyn was queen of England; for the little finger of her left hand had a
double tip, and the long, graceful sleeves effectually concealed the
deformity.</p>

<p>In my book entitled <i>Child Life in Colonial Days</i> I have given over
thirty portraits of American children. These show the changes of fashions,
the wear of children at various periods and ages. Childish dress ever
reflected the dress of their elders, and often closely imitated it. Two
very charming costumes are worn by two little children of the province of
South Carolina. The little girl is but two years old. She is Ellinor
Cordes, and was painted about 1740. She is a lovely little child of French
features and French daintiness of dress, albeit a bright yellow brocaded
satin would seem rather gorgeous attire for a girl of her years. The boy is
her kinsman, Daniel Ravenel, and was then about five years old. He wore
what might be termed a frock with spreading petticoats, which touched the
ground; there is a decided boyishness in the tight-fitting, trim waistcoat
with its silver buttons and lace, and the befrogged coat with broad cuffs
and wrist ruffles, and turned-over revers, and narrow linen inner collar.
It is an exceptionally pleasing boy's dress, for a little boy.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar but more feminine coat is worn by Thomas Aston
Coffin; it opens in front over a white satin petticoat, and it has a
low-cut neck and sleeves shortened to the elbow, and worn over full white
undersleeves. Other portraits by Copley show the same dress of white satin,
which boys wore till six years of age.</p>

<p>Copley's portrait of his own children is given on a later page. This
family group always startles all who have seen it only in photographs; for
its colors are so unexpected, so frankly crude and vivid. The individuals
are all charming. The oldest child, the daughter, Elizabeth, stands in the
foreground in a delightful white frock of striped gauze. This is worn over
a pink slip, and the pink tints show in the thinner folds of whiteness; a
fine piece of texture-painting. The gauze sash is tied in a vast knot, and
lies out in a train; this is a more vivid pink, inclining to the tint of
the old-rose damask furniture-covering. She wears a pretty little net and
muslin cap with a cap-pin like a tiny rose. This single figure is not
excelled, I think, by any child's portrait in foreign galleries, nor is it
often equalled. Nor can the exquisite expression of childish love and
confidence seen on the face of the boy, John Singleton Copley, Junior, who
later became Lord Lyndhurst, find a rival in painting. It is an unspeakably
touching portrait to all who have seen upturned close to their own eyes the
trusting and loving face of a beautiful son as he clung with strong boyish
arms and affection to his mother's neck.</p>

<p>This little American boy, who became Lord Chancellor of England, wears a
nankeen suit with a lilac-tinted sash. It is his beaver hat with gold
hatband and blue feather that lies on the ground at the feet of the
grandfather, Richard Clarke. The baby, held by the grandfather, wears a
coral and bells on a lilac sash-ribbon; such a coral as we see in many
portraits of infants. Another child in white-embroidered robe and dark
yellow sash completes this beautiful family picture. Its great fault to me
is the blue of Mrs. Copley's gown, which is as vivid as a peacock's breast.
This painting is deemed Copley's masterpiece; but an equal interest is that
it is such an absolute and open expression of Copley's lovable character
and upright life. In it we can read his affectionate nature, his love of
his sweet wife, his happy home-relations, and his pride in his beautiful
children.</p>

<p>There is ample proof, not only in the inventories which chance to be
preserved, but in portraits of the times, that children's dress in the
eighteenth century was often costly. Of course the children of wealthy
parents only would have their portraits painted; but their dress was as
rich as the dress of the children of the nobility in England at the same
time. You can see this in the colored reproduction of the portraits of Hon.
James Bowdoin and his sister, Augusta, afterwards Lady Temple. That they
were good likenesses is proved by the fact that the faces are strongly like
those of the same persons in more mature years. You find little Augusta
changed but slightly in matronhood in the fine pastel by Copley. In this
portrait of the two Bowdoin children, the entire dress is given. Seldom are
the shoes shown. These are interesting, for the boy's square-toed black
shoes with buckles are wholly unlike his sister's blue morocco slippers
with turned-up peaks and gilt ornaments from toe to instep, making a
foot-gear much like certain Turkish slippers seen to-day. Her hair has the
bedizenment of beads and feathers, which were worn by young girls for as
many years as their mothers wore the same. The young lad's dress is
precisely like his father's. There is much charm in these straight little
figures. They have the aristocratic bearing which is a family trait of all
of that kin. I should not deem Lady Temple ever a beauty, though she was
called so by Manasseh Cutler, a minister who completely yielded to her
charms when she was a grandmother and forty-four. This portrait of brother
and sister is, I believe, by Blackburn. The dress is similar and the date
the same as the portrait of the Misses Royall (one of whom became Lady
Pepperell), which is by Blackburn.</p>

<p>I have written at length in Chapter IV of a grandmother in the Hall
family and of the Hall family connection. Let me tell of another
grandmother, Madam Lydia Coleman, the daughter of the old Indian fighter,
Captain Joshua Scottow. She, like Madam Symonds and Madam Stoddard, had had
several husbands--Colonel Benjamin Gibbs, Attorney-General Anthony
Checkley, and William Coleman. The Hall children were her grandchildren;
and came to Boston for schooling at one time. Many letters exist of Hon.
Hugh Hall to and from his grandmother, Madam Coleman. She writes
thus.--</p>

<p>Madam Coleman, after this handful, was given charge of his sister Sarah.
When Missy arrived from the Barbadoes, she was eight years old. She brought
with her a maid. The grandmother wrote back cheerfully to the parents that
the child was well and brisk, as indeed she was. All the very young
gentlemen and young ladies of Boston Brahmin blood paid her visits, and she
gave a feast at a child's dancing-party with the sweetmeats left over from
her sea-store. Her stay in her grandmother's household was surprisingly
brief. She left unbidden with her maid, and went to a Mr. Binning's to
board; she sent home word to the Barbadoes that her grandmother made her
drink water with her meals. Her brother wrote to Madam Coleman:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We were all persuaded of your tender and hearty affection
to my Sister when we recommended her to your parental care. We are sorry
to hear of her Independence in removing from under the Benign Influences
of your Wing &amp; am surprised she dare do it without our leave or
consent or that Mr. Binning receive her at his house before he knew how we
were affected to it. We shall now desire Mr. Binning to resign her with
her waiting maid to you and in our Letter to him have strictly ordered her
to Return to your House.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>But no brother could control this spirited young damsel. Three months
later a letter from Madam Coleman read thus:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sally wont go to school nor to church and wants a nue
muff and a great many other things she don't need. I tell her fine things
are cheaper in Barbadoes. She is well and brisk, says her Brother has
nothing to do with her as long as her father is
alive.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Hugh Hall wrote in return, saying his daughter ought to have one room to
sleep in, and her maid another, that it was not befitting children of their
station to drink water, they should have wine and beer. We cannot wonder
that they dressed like their elders since they were treated like their
elders in other respects.</p>

<p>The dress of very young girls was often extraordinarily rich. We find
this order sent to London in 1739, for finery for Mary Cabell, daughter of
Dr. William Cabell of Virginia, when she was but thirteen years old:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;1 Prayer Book (almost every such inventory had this item).<br>
1 Red Silk Petticoat.<br>
1 Very good broad Silver laced hat and hat-band.<br>
1 Pair Stays 17 inches round the waist.<br>

<p>A Virginia gentleman, Colonel William Fleming, kept for several years a
close account of the money he spent for his little daughters, who were
young misses of ten and eleven in the year 1787. The most expensive single
items are bonnets, each at &pound;4 10s.; an umbrella, &pound;2 8s. Cloth
cloaks and saddles and bridles for riding were costly items. Tamboured
muslin was at that time 18s. a yard; durant, 3s. 6d.; lutestring, 12s.;
calico, 6s. 3d. Scarlet cloaks for each girl cost &pound;2 14s. each. Other
dress materials besides those named above were cambric, linen, cotton,
osnaburgs, negro cotton, book-muslin, ermin, nankeen, persian, Turkey
cotton, shalloon, and swanskin. There were many yards of taste and ribbon,
black lace, and edgings, and gauze--gauze--gauze. A curious item several
times appearing is a &quot;paper bonnet,&quot; not bonnet-paper, which
latter was a constant purchase on women's lists. There were pen-knives,
&quot;scanes of silk,&quot; crooked combs, morocco shoes, &quot;nitting
pins,&quot; constant &quot;sticks of pomatum,&quot; fans,
&quot;chanes,&quot; a shawl, a tamboured coat, gloves, stockings, trunks,
bands and clasps, tooth-brushes, silk gloves, necklaces, &quot;fingered
gloves,&quot; silk stockings, handkerchiefs, china teacups and saucers and
silver spoons. All these show a very generous outfit.</p>

<p>In the year 1770 a delightful, engaging little child came to Boston from
Nova Scotia to live for a time with her aunt, a Boston gentlewoman, and to
attend Boston schools. For the amusement of her parents so far away, and
for practice in penmanship, she kept during the years 1771 and part of 1772
a diary. She was but ten years old when she began, but her intelligence and
originality make this diary a valuable record of domestic life in Boston at
that date. I have had the pleasure of publishing her diary with notes under
the title, <i>Diary of Anna Green Winslow, a Boston School Girl, in the
Year 1771</i>. I lived so much with her while transcribing her words that
she seems almost like a child of my own. Like other unusual children she
died young--when but nineteen. She was not so gifted and wonderful and rare
a creature as that star among children, Marjorie Fleming, yet she was in
many ways equally interesting; she was a frank, homely little flower of New
England life destined never to grow old or weary, or tired or sad, but to
live forever in eternal, happy childhood, through the magic living words in
the hundred pages of her time-stained diary.</p>

<p>She was of what Dr. Holmes called Boston Brahmin blood, was related to
many of the wealthiest and best families of Boston and vicinity, and knew
the best society. Dress was to her a matter of distinct importance, and her
clothes were carefully fashionable. Her distress over wearing &quot;an old
red Domino&quot; was genuine. We have in her words many references to her
garments, and we find her dress very handsome. This is what she wore at a
child's party:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I was dressed in my yellow coat, black bib &amp; apron,
black feathers on my head, my past comb &amp; all my past garnet,
marquesett &amp; jet pins, together with my silver plume--my loket, rings,
black collar round my neck, black mitts &amp; yards of blue ribbin (black
&amp; blue is high tast), striped tucker &amp; ruffels (not my best) &amp;
my silk shoes completed my dress.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>A few days later she writes:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I wore my black bib &amp; apron, my pompedore shoes, the
cap my Aunt Storer since presented me with (blue ribbins on it) &amp; a
very handsome locket in the shape of a hart she gave me, the past Pin my
Hon'd Papa presented me with in my cap. My new cloak &amp; bonnet, my
pompedore gloves, &amp;c. And I would tell you that <i>for the first time
they all on lik'd my dress very much</i>. My cloak &amp; bonnett are
really very handsome &amp; so they had need be. For they cost an amasing
sight of money, not quite &pound;45, tho' Aunt Suky said that she suppos'd
Aunt Deming would be frighted out of her Wits at the money it cost. I have
got <i>one</i> covering by the cost that is genteel &amp; I like it much
myself.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>As this was in the times of depreciated values, &pound;45 was not so
large a sum to expend for a girl's outdoor garments as at first sight
appears.</p>

<p>She gives a very exact account of her successions of head-gear, some
being borrowed finery. She apparently managed to rise entirely above the
hated &quot;black hatt&quot; and red domino, which she patronizingly said
would be &quot;Decent for Common Occations.&quot; She writes:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Last Thursday I purchased with my aunt Deming's leave a
very beautiful white feather hat, that is the outside, which is a bit of
white hollowed with the feathers sew'd on in a most curious manner; white
and unsully'd as the falling snow. As I am, as we say, a Daughter of
Liberty I chuse to were as much of our own manufactory as pocible.... My
Aunt says if I behave myself very well indeed, not else, she will give me a
garland of flowers to orniment it, tho' she has layd aside the biziness of
flower-making.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>The dress described and portrayed of these children all seems very
mature; but children were quickly grown up in colonial days. Cotton Mather
wrote, &quot;New English youth are very sharp and early ripe in their
capacities.&quot; They married early; though none of the
&quot;child-marriages&quot; of England disfigure the pages of our history.
Sturdy Endicott would not permit the marriage of his ward, Rebecca Cooper,
an &quot;inheritrice,&quot;--though Governor Winthrop wished her for his
nephew,--because the girl was but fifteen. I am surprised at this, for
marriages at fifteen were common enough. My far-away grandmother, Mary
Burnet, married William Browne, when she was fourteen; another grandmother,
Mary Philips, married her cousin at thirteen, and there is every evidence
that the match was arranged with little heed of the girl's wishes. It was
the happiest of marriages. Boys became men by law when sixteen. Winthrop
named his son as executor of his will when the boy was fourteen--but there
were few boys like that boy. We find that the Virginia tutor who taught in
the Carter family just previous to the war of the Revolution deemed a young
lady of thirteen no longer a child.</p>

<p>The christening of an infant was not only a sacrament of the church, and
thus of highest importance, but it was also of secular note. It was a time
of great rejoicing, of good wishes, of gift-making. In mediaeval times, the
child was arrayed by the priest in a white robe which had been anointed
with sacred oil, and called a chrismale, or a chrisom. If the child died
within a month, it was buried in this robe and called a chrisom-child. The
robe was also called a christening palm or pall. When the custom of
redressing the child in a robe at the altar had passed away, the
christening palm still was used and was thrown over the child when it was
brought out to receive visitors. This robe was also termed a bearing-cloth,
a christening sheet, and a cade-cloth.</p>

<p>This fine coverlet of state, what we would now call a christening
blanket, was usually made of silk; often it was richly embroidered,
sometimes with a text of Scripture. It was generally lace-bordered, or
edged with a narrow, home-woven silk fringe. The christening-blanket of
Governor Bradford of the Plymouth Colony still is owned by a descendant; it
is whole of fabric and unfaded of dye. It is rich crimson silk, soft of
texture, like heavy sarcenet silk, and is powdered at regular distances
about six inches apart with conventional sprays of flowers, embroidered
chiefly in pink and yellow, in minute silk cross-stitch. Another beautiful
silk christening blanket was quilted in an intricate flower pattern in
almost imperceptible stitches. Another of yellow satin has a design in
white floss that gives it the appearance of being trimmed with white silk
lace. Best of all was to embroider the cloth with designs and initials and
emblems and biblical references. A coat-of-arms or crest was very elegant.
The words, &quot;God Bless the Babe,&quot; were not left wholly to the
pincushions which every babe had given him or her, but appeared on the
christening blanket. A curious design shown me was called <i>The Tree of
Knowledge</i>. The figure of a child in cap, apron, bib, and hanging
sleeves stands pointing to a tree upon which grew books as though they were
apples. The open pages of each book-apple is printed with a title, as,
<i>The New England Primer, Lilly's Grammar, Janeway's Holy Children, The
Prodigal Daughter.</i></p>

<p>An inventory of the christening garments of a child in the seventeenth
century reads thus:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;1. A lined white figured satin cap.<br>
2. A lined white satin cap embroidered in sprays with gold coloured silk.<br>
3. A white satin palm embroidered in sprays of yellow silk to match.
This is 44 inches by 34 inches in size.<br>
4. A palm of rich 'still yellow' silk lined with white satin. This is 54
inches by 48 inches in size.<br>
5. A pair of deep cuffs of white satin, lace trimmed and embroidered.<br>
6. A pair of linen mittens trimmed with narrow lace, the back of the
fingers outlined with yellow silk figures.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>The satin cuffs were for the wear of the older person who carried the
child. The infant was placed upon the larger palm or cloth, and the smaller
one thrown over him, over his petticoats. The inner cap was very tight to
the head. The outer was embroidered; often it turned back in a band.</p>

<p>There was a significance in the use of yellow; it is the altar color for
certain church festivals, and was proper for the pledging of the child.</p>

<p>All these formalities of christening in the Church of England were not
abandoned by the Separatists. New England children were just as carefully
christened and dressed for christening as any child in the Church of
England. In the reign of James I tiny shirts with little bands or sleeves
or cuffs wrought in silk or in coventry-blue thread were added to the gift
of spoons from the sponsors. I have one of these little coventry-blue
embroidered things with quaint little sleeves; too faded, I regret, to
reveal any pattern to the camera.</p>

<p>The christening shirts and mittens given by the sponsors are said to be
a relic of the ancient custom of presenting white clothes to the neophytes
when converted to Christianity. These &quot;Christening Sets&quot; are
preserved in many families.</p>

<p>Of the dress of infants of colonial times we can judge from the articles
of clothing which have been preserved till this day. These are of course
the better garments worn by babies, not their everyday dress; their simpler
attire has not survived, but their christening robes, their finer shirts
and petticoats and caps remain.</p>

<p>Linen formed the chilling substructure of their dress, thin linen,
low-necked, short-sleeved shirts; and linen remained the underwear of
infants until thirty years ago. I do not wonder that these little linen
shirts were worn for centuries. They are infinitely daintier than the
finest silk or woollen underwear that have succeeded them; they are edged
with narrowest thread lace, and hemstitched with tiny rows of stitches or
corded with tiny cords, and sometimes embroidered by hand in minute
designs. They were worn by all babies from the time of James I, never
varying one stitch in shape; but I fear this pretty garment of which our
infants were bereft a few years ago will never crowd out the warm,
present-day silk wear. This wholly infantile article of childish dress had
tiny little revers or collarettes or laps made to turn over outside the
robe or slip like a minute bib, and these laps were beautifully oversewn
where the corners joined the shirt, to prevent tearing down at this seam.
These tiny shirts were the dearest little garments ever made or dreamed of.
When a baby had on a fresh, corded slip, low of neck, with short, puffed
sleeve, and the tiny hemstitched laps were turned down outside the neck of
the slip, and the little sleeves were caught up by fine strings of
gold-clasped pink coral, the baby's dimpled shoulders and round head rose
up out of the little shirt-laps like some darling flower.</p>

<p>I have seen an infant's shirt and a cap embroidered on the laps with the
coat-of-arms of the Lux and Johnson families and the motto, &quot;God Bless
the Babe;&quot; these delicate garments, the work of fairies, were worn in
infancy by the Revolutionary soldier, Governor Johnson of Virginia.</p>

<p>In the Essex Institute in Salem, Massachusetts, are the baptismal shirt
and mittens of the Pilgrim father, William Bradford, second governor of the
Plymouth colony, who was born in 1590. They are shown <a
href="#Christening_Shirt_and_Mitts_of_Governor_Bradford">here</a>. All are
of firm, close-woven, homespun linen, but the little mittens have been worn
at the ends by the active friction of baby hands, and are patched with red
and yellow figured &quot;chiney&quot; or calico. A similar colored material
frills the sleeves and neck. This may have been part of their ornamentation
when first made, but it looks extraneous.</p>

<p>The sleeves of this shirt are plaited or goffered in a way that seems
wholly lost; this is what I have already described--<i>pinching</i>. I have
seen the sleeve of a child's dress thus pinched which had been worn by a
little girl aged three. The wrist-cuff measured about five inches around,
and was stoutly corded. Upon ripping the sleeve apart, it was found that
the strip of fine mull which was thus pinched into the sleeve was two yards
in length. The cuff flared slightly, else even this length of sheer lawn
could not have been confined at the wrist. In the so-called
&quot;Museum,&quot; gloomily scattered around the famous old South Church
edifice in Boston, are fine examples of this pinched work.</p>

<p>Many of the finest existing specimens of old guipure, Flanders, and
needlepoint laces in England and America are preserved on the ancient
shirts, mitts, caps, and bearing-cloths of infants. Often there is a little
padded bib of guipure lace accompanied with tiny mittens like these.</p>

<p>This pair was wrought and worn in the sixteenth century, and the
stitches and work are those of the Flanders point laces. I have seen tiny
mitts knitted of silk, of fine linen thread, also made of linen,
hem-stitched, or worked in drawn-work, or embroidered, and one pair of
mittens, and the cap that matched was of tatting-work done in the finest of
thread. No needlepoint could be more beautiful. Some are shown on <a
href="#Flanders_Lace_Mitts.">here</a>.</p>

<p>Mitts of yellow nankeen or silk, made with long wrists or arms, were
also worn by babies, and must have proved specially irritating to tiny
little hands and arms. These had the seams sewed over and over with colored
silks in a curiously intricate netted stitch.</p>

<p>I have an infant's cap with two squares of lace set in the crown, one
over each ear. The lace is of a curious design; a conventionalized vase or
urn on a standard. I recognize it as the lace and pattern known as
&quot;pot-lace,&quot; made for centuries at Antwerp, and worn there by old
women on their caps with a devotion to a single pattern that is
unparalleled. It was the &quot;flower-pot&quot; symbol of the Annunciation.
The earliest representation of the Angel Gabriel in the Annunciation showed
him with lilies in his hand; then these lilies were set in a vase. In years
the angel has disappeared and then the lilies, and the lily-pot only
remains. It is a whimsical fancy that this symbol of Romanism should have
been carefully transferred to adorn the pate of a child of the Puritans.
The place of the medallion, set over each ear, is so unusual that I think
it must have had some significance. I wonder whether they were ever set
thus in caps of heavy silk or linen to let the child hear more readily, as
he certainly would through the thin lace net.</p>

<p>The word &quot;beguine&quot; meant a nun; and thus derivatively a nun's
close cap. This was altered in spelling to biggin, and for a time a nun's
plain linen cap was thus called. By Shakespere's day biggin had become
wholly a term for a child's cap. It was a plain phrase and a plain cap of
linen. Shakespere calls them &quot;homely biggens.&quot;</p>

<p>I have seen it stated that the biggin was a night-cap. When Queen
Elizabeth lost her mother, Anne Boleyn, she was but three years old, a
neglected little creature. A lady of the court wrote that the child had
&quot;no manner of linen, nor for-smocks, nor kerchiefs, nor rails, nor
body-stitches, nor handkerchiefs, nor sleeves, nor mufflers, nor
biggins.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1636 Mary Dudley, the daughter of Governor John Winthrop, had a
little baby. She did not live in Boston town, therefore her mother had to
purchase supplies for her; and many letters crossed, telling of wants, and
their relief. &quot;Holland for biggins&quot; was eagerly sought. At that
date all babies wore caps. I mean English and French, Dutch and Spanish,
all mothers deemed it unwise and almost improper for a young baby ever to
be seen bare-headed. With the imperfect heating and many draughts in all
the houses, this mode of dress may have been wholly wise and indeed
necessary. Every child's head was covered, as the pictures of children in
this book show, until he or she was several years old. The finest
needlework and lace stitches were lavished on these tiny infants' caps,
which were not, when thus adorned and ornamented, called biggins.</p>

<p>A favorite trimming for night-caps and infants' caps is a sort of
quilting in a leaf and vine pattern, done with a white cord inserted
between outer and inner pieces of linen--a cord stuffing, as it were. It
does not seem oversuited for caps to be worn in bed or by little infants,
as the stiff cords must prove a disagreeable cushion. This work was done as
early as the seventeenth century; but nearly all the pieces preserved were
made in the early years of the nineteenth century in the revival of
needlework then so universal.</p>

<p>Often a velvet cap was worn outside the biggin or lace cap.</p>

<p>I have never seen a woollen petticoat that was worn by an infant of
pre-Revolutionary days. I think infants had no woollen petticoats; their
shirts, petticoats, and gowns were of linen or some cotton stuff like
dimity. Warmth of clothing was given by tiny shawls pinned round the
shoulders, and heavier blankets and quilts and shawls in which baby and
petticoats were wholly enveloped.</p>

<p>The baby dresses of olden times are either rather shapeless sacques
drawn in at the neck with narrow cotton ferret or linen bobbin, or little
straight-waisted gowns of state. All were exquisitely made by hand, and
usually of fine stuff. Many are trimmed with fine cording.</p>

<p>It is astounding to note the infinite number of stitches put in
garments. An infant's slips quilted with a single tiny backstitch in a
regular design of interlaced squares, stars, and rounds. By counting the
number of rounds and the stitches in each, and so on, it has been found
that there are 397,000 stitches in that dress. Think of the time spent even
by the quickest sewer over such a piece of work.</p>

<p>Within a few years we have shortened the long clothes worn by youngest
infants; twenty-five years ago the handsome dress of an infant, such as the
christening-robe, was so long that when the child was held on the arm of
its standing nurse or mother, the edge of the robe barely escaped touching
the ground. Two hundred years ago, a baby's dress was much shorter. In the
family group of Charles I and Henrietta Maria and their children, in the
Copley family picture, and in the picture of the Cadwalader family, we find
the little baby in scarce &quot;three-quarters length&quot; of robe. With
this exception it is astonishing to find how little infants' dress has
changed during the two centuries. In 1889, at the Stuart Exhibition, some
of the infant dresses of Charles I were shown. They had been preserved in
the family of Sir Thomas Coventry, Lord Keeper. And Charles II's baby linen
was on view in the New Gallery in 1901. Both sets had the dainty little
shirts, slips, bibs, mitts, and all the babies' dress of fifty years ago,
and the changes since then have been few. The &quot;barrow-coat,&quot; a
square of flannel wrapped around an infant's body below the arms with the
part below the feet turned up and pinned, was part of the old
swaddling-clothes; and within ten years it has been largely abandoned for a
flannel petticoat on a band or waist. The bands, or binders, have always
been the same as to-day, and the bibs. The lace cuffs and lace mittens were
left off before the caps. The shirt is the most important change.</p>

<p>Nowadays a little infant wears long clothes till three, four, or even
eight months old; then he is put in short dresses about as long as he is.
In colonial days when a boy was taken from his swaddling-clothes, he was
dressed in a short frock with petticoats and was &quot;coated&quot; or
sometimes &quot;short-coated.&quot; When he left off coats, he donned
breeches. In families of sentiment and affection, the &quot;coating&quot;
of a boy was made a little festival. So was also the assumption of breeches
an important event--as it really is, as we all know who have boys.</p>

<p>One of the most charming of all grandmothers' letters was written by a
doting English grandmother to her son. Lord Chief Justice North, telling of
the &quot;leaving off of coats&quot; of his motherless little son, Francis
Guilford, then six years old. The letter is dated October 10, 1679:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;DEAR SON:<br> You cannot beleeve the great concerne
that was in the whole family here last Wednesday, it being the day that
the taylor was to helpe to dress little ffrank in his breeches in order to
the making an everyday suit by it. Never had any bride that was to be
drest upon her weding night more handes about her, some the legs, some the
armes, the taylor butt'ning, and others putting on the sword, and so many
lookers on that had I not a ffinger amongst I could not have seen him.
When he was quite drest he acted his part as well as any of them for he
desired he might goe downe to inquire for the little gentleman that was
there the day before in a black coat, and speak to the man to tell the
gentleman when he came from school that there was a gallant with very fine
clothes and a sword to have waited upon him and would come again upon
Sunday next. But this was not all, there was great contrivings while he
was dressing who should have the first salute; but he sayd if old Joan had
been here, she should, but he gave it to me to quiett them all. They were
very fitt, everything, and he looks taller and prettyer than in his coats.
Little Charles rejoyced as much as he did for he jumpt all the while about
him and took notice of everything. I went to Bury, and bot everything for
another suitt which will be finisht on Saturday so the coats are to be
quite left off on Sunday. I consider it is not yett terme time and since
you could not have the pleasure of the first sight, I resolved you should
have a full relation from<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yo'r most
Aff'nate Mother<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A. North.<br> <br>
&quot;When he was drest he asked Buckle whether muffs were out of fashion
because they had not sent him one.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>This affectionate letter, written to a great and busy statesman, the
Lord Keeper of the Seals, shows how pure and delightful domestic life in
England could be; it shows how beautiful it was after Puritanism perfected
the English home.</p>

<p>In an old family letter dated 1780 I find this sentence:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Mary is most wise with her child, and hath no
new-fangledness. She has little David in what she wore herself, a pudding
and pinner.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>For a time these words &quot;pudding and pinner&quot; were a puzzle; and
long after pinner was defined we could not even guess at a pudding. But now
I know two uses of the word &quot;pudding&quot; which are in no dictionary.
One is the stuffing of a man's great neck-cloth in front, under the chin.
The other is a thick roll or cushion stuffed with wool or some soft filling
and furnished with strings. This pudding was tied round the head of a
little child while it was learning to walk. The head was thus protected
from serious bruises or injury. Nollekens noted with satisfaction such a
pudding on the head of an infant, and said: &quot;That is right. I always
wore a pudding, and all children should.&quot; I saw one upon a child's
head last summer in a New England town; I asked the mother what it was, and
she answered, &quot;A pudding-cap&quot;; that it made children soft
(idiotic) to bump the head frequently.</p>

<p>The word &quot;pinner&quot; has two meanings. The earlier use was
precisely that of pinafore, or pincurtle, or pincloth--a child's apron.
Thus we read in the Harvard College records, of the expenses of the year
1677, of &quot;Linnen Cloth for Table Pinners,&quot; which makes us suspect
that Harvard students of that day had to wear bibs at commons.</p>

<p>All children wore aprons, which might be called pinners; these were
aprons with pinned-up bibs; or they might be tiers, which were sleeved
aprons covering the whole waist, sleeves, and skirt, an outer slip,
buttoned in the back.</p>

<p>A severe and ancient moralist looked forth from her window in Worcester,
one day last spring, at a band of New England children running to their
morning school. She gazed over her glasses reprovingly, and turned to me
with bitterness: &quot;There they go! <i>Such</i> mothers as they must
have! Not a pinner nor a sleeved tier among 'em.&quot;</p>

<p>The sleeved tier occupied a singular place in childish opinion in my
youth; and I find the same feeling anent it had existed for many
generations. It was hated by all children, regarded as something to be
escaped from at the earliest possible date. You had to wear sleeved tiers
as you had to have the mumps. It was a thing to endure with what childish
patience and fortitude you could command for a short time; but thoughtful,
tender parents would not make you suffer it long.</p>

<p>There were aprons, and aprons. Pinners and tiers were for use, but there
were elegant aprons for ornament. Did not Queen Anne wear one? Even babies
wore them. The little Padishal child has one richly laced. I have seen a
beautiful apron for a little child of three. It was edged with a straight
insertion of Venetian point like that pictured <a
href="#Old_Venice_Point_Lace.">here</a>. It had been made in 1690. Tender
affection for a beloved and beautiful little child preserved it in one
trunk in the same attic for sixty-five years; and a beautiful sympathy for
that mother's long sorrow kept the apron untouched by young lace-lovers.
This lace has white horsehair woven into the edge.</p>

<p>We find George Washington ordering for his little stepdaughter (a
well-dressed child if ever there was one), when she was six years old,
&quot;A fashionable cap or fillet with bib apron.&quot; And a few years
later he orders, &quot;Tuckers, Bibs, and Aprons if Fashionable.&quot; Boys
wore aprons as long as they wore coats; aprons with stomachers or bibs of
drawn-work and lace, or of stiffly starched lawn; aprons just like those of
their sisters. It was hard to bear. Hoop-coat, masks, packthread
stays--these seem strange dress for growing girls.</p>

<p>George Washington sent abroad for masks for his wife and his little
stepdaughter, &quot;Miss Custis,&quot; when the little girl was six years
old; and &quot;children's masks&quot; are often named in bills of sale.
Loo-masks were small half-masks, and were also imported in all sizes.</p>

<p>The face of Mrs. Madison, familiarly known as &quot;Dolly Madison,&quot;
wife of President James Madison, long retained the beauty of youth. Much of
this was surely due to a faithful mother, who, when little Dolly Payne was
sent to school, sewed a sun-bonnet on the child's head every morning,
placed on her arms and hands long gloves, and made her wear a mask to keep
every ray of sunlight from her face. When masks were so universally worn by
women, it is not strange, after all, that children wore them.</p>

<p>I read with horror an advertisement of John McQueen, a New York
stay-maker in 1767, that he has children's packthread stays, children's
bone stays, and &quot;neat polished steel collars for young Misses so much
worn at the boarding schools in London.&quot; Poor little &quot;young
Misses&quot;!</p>

<p>There were also &quot;turned stays, jumps, gazzets, costrells and
caushets&quot; (which were perhaps corsets) to make children appear
straight. Costrells and gazzets we know not to-day. Jumps were feeble
stays.</p>

Now a slattern in jumps.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Jumps were allied to jimps, and perhaps to jupe; and I think jumper is a
cousin of a word. One pair of stays I have seen is labelled as having been
made for a boy of five. One of the worst instruments of torture I ever
beheld was a pair of child's stays worn in 1760. They were made, not of
little strips of wood, but of a large piece of board, front and back,
tightly sewed into a buckram jacket and re&euml;nforced across at right
angles and diagonally over the hips (though really there were no
hip-places) with bars of whalebone and steel. The tin corsets I have heard
of would not have been half as ill to wear. It is true, too, that needles
were placed in the front of the stays, that the stay-wearer who &quot;poked
her head&quot; would be well pricked. The daughter of General Nathanael
Greene, the Revolutionary patriot, told her grandchildren that she sat many
hours every day in her girlhood, with her feet in stocks and strapped to a
backboard. A friend has a chair of ordinary size, save that the seat is
about four inches wide from the front edge of seat to the back. And the
back is well worn at certain points where a heavy leather strap strapped up
the young girl who was tortured in it for six years of her life. The result
of back board, stocks, steel collar, wooden stays, is shown in such figures
as have Dorothy Q. and her sister Elizabeth. Elizabeth Storer, on page 98
of my <i>Child Life in Colonial Days</i>, is an extreme example,
straight-backed indeed, but narrow-chested to match.</p>

<p>Dr. Holmes wrote in jest, but he wrote in truth, too:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;They braced My Aunt against a board<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make her straight and tall,<br>
&nbsp;They laced her up, they starved her down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make her light and small.<br>
&nbsp;They pinched her feet, they singed her hair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They screwed it up with pins,<br>
&nbsp;Oh, never mortal suffered more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In penance for her sins.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Nankeen was the favorite wear for boys, even before the Revolution. The
little figure of the boy who became Lord Lyndhurst, shown in the Copley
family portrait, is dressed in nankeen; he is the engaging, loving child
looking up in his mother's face. Nankeen was worn summer and winter by men,
and women, and children. If it were deemed too thin and too damp a wear for
delicate children in extreme winters, then a yellow color in wool was
preferred for children's dress. I have seen a little pair of breeches of
yellow flannel made precisely like these nankeen breeches on this page.
They were worn in 1768. Carlyle in his <i>Sartor Resartus</i> gives this
account of the childhood of the professor and philosopher of his
book:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;My first short clothes were of yellow serge; or rather, I
should say, my first short cloth; for the vesture was one and indivisible,
reaching from neck to ankle; a single body with four limbs; of which
fashion how little could I then divine the architectural, much less the
moral significance.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>It is a curious coincidence that a great philosopher of our own world
wore a precisely similar dress in his youth. Madam Mary Bradford writes in
a private letter, at the age of one hundred and three, of her life in 1805
in the household of Rev. Joseph Emerson. Ralph Waldo Emerson was then a
little child of two years, and he and his brother William till several
years old were dressed wholly in yellow flannel, by night and by day. When
they put on trousers, which was at about the age of seven, they wore
complete home-made suits of nankeen. The picture amuses me of the
philosophical child, Ralph Waldo, walking soberly around in ugly yellow
flannel, contentedly sucking his thumb; for Mrs. Bradford records that he
was the hardest child to break of sucking his thumb whom she ever had seen
during her long life. I cannot help wondering whether in their soul-to-soul
talks Emerson ever told Carlyle of the yellow woollen dress of his
childhood, and thus gave him the thought of the child's dress for his
philosopher.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the children who were our grandparents. French fashions
were not absorbingly the rage in America until after some amelioration of
dress had come to French children. Mercier wrote at length at the close of
the eighteenth century of the abominable artificiality and restraint in
dress of French children; their great wigs, full-skirted coats, immense
ruffles, swords on thigh, and hat in hand. He contrasts them disparagingly
with English boys. The English boy was certainly more robust, but I find no
difference in dress. Wigs, swords, ruffles, may be seen at that time both
in English and American portraits. But an amelioration of dress did come to
both English and American boys through the introduction of pantaloons, and
a change to little girls' dress through the invention of pantalets, but the
changes came first to France, in spite of Mercier's animadversions. These
changes will be left until the later pages of this book; for during nearly
all the two hundred years of which I write children's dress varied little.
It followed the changes of the parent's dress, and adopted some modes to a
degree but never to an extreme.</p>

<h3>PERUKES AND PERIWIGS</h3>
<p style='text-indent: 0em'> <img src="images\initialt.png" align=left
alt="T">o-day, when every man, save a football player or some eccentric
reformer or religious fanatic, displays in youth a close-cropped head, and
when even hoary age is seldom graced with flowing, silvery locks, when
women's hair is dressed in simplicity, we can scarcely realize the
important and formal part the hair played in the dress of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>In the great eagerness shown from earliest colonial days to acquire and
reproduce in the New World every change of mode in the Old, to purchase
rich dress, and to assume novel dress, no article was sought for more
speedily and more anxiously than the wig. It has proved an interesting
study to compare the introduction of wigs in England with the wear of the
same form of head-gear in America. Wigs were not in general use in England
when Plymouth and Boston were settled; though in Elizabeth's day a
&quot;peryuke&quot; had been bought for the court fool. They were not in
universal wear till the close of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The &quot;Wig Mania&quot; arose in France in the reign of Louis XV. In
1656 the king had forty court perruquiers, who were termed and deemed
artists, and had their academy. The wigs they produced were superb. It is
told that one cost &pound;200, a sum equal in purchasing power to-day to
$5000. The French statesman and financier, Colbert, aghast at the vast sums
spent for foreign hair, endeavored to introduce a sort of cap to supplant
the wig, but fashions are not made that way.</p>

<p>For information of English manners and customs in that day, I turn (and
never in vain) to those fascinating volumes, the <i>Verney Memoirs</i>.
From them I learn this of early wig-wearing by Englishmen; that Sir Ralph
Verney, though in straitened circumstances during his enforced residence
abroad, felt himself compelled to follow the French mode, which at that
period, 1646, had not reached England. That exemplary gentleman paid twelve
livres for a wig, when he was sadly short of money for household
necessaries. It was an elaborate wig, curled in great rings, with two locks
tied with black ribbon, and made without any parting at the back. This wig
was powdered.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph wrote to his wife that a good hair-powder was very difficult
to get and costly, even in France. It was an appreciable addition to the
weight of the wig and to the expense, large quantities being used,
sometimes as much as two pounds at a time. It added not only to the
expense, but to the discomfort, inconvenience, and untidiness of
wig-wearing.</p>

<p>Pomatum made of fat, and that sometimes rancid, was used to make the
powder stick; and noxious substances were introduced into the powder, as a
certain kind is mentioned which must not be used alone, for it would
produce headache.</p>

<p>Charles II was the earliest king represented on the Great Seal wearing a
large periwig. Dr. Doran assures us that the king did not bring the fashion
to Whitehall. &quot;He forbade,&quot; we are told, &quot;the members of the
Universities to wear periwigs, smoke tobacco, or read their sermons. The
members did all three, and Charles soon found himself doing the first
two.&quot;</p>

<p>Pepys's <i>Diary</i> contains much interesting information concerning
the wigs of this reign. On 2d of November, 1663, he writes: &quot;I heard
the Duke say that he was going to wear a periwig, and says the King also
will, never till this day observed that the King is mighty gray.&quot; It
was doubtless this change in the color of his Majesty's hair that induced
him to assume the head-dress he had previously so strongly condemned.</p>

<p>The wig he adopted was very voluminous, richly curled, and black. He was
very dark. &quot;Odds fish! but I'm an ugly black fellow!&quot; he said of
himself when he looked at his portrait. Loyal colonists quickly followed
royal example and complexion. We have very good specimens of this curly
black wig in many American portraits.</p>

<p>As might be expected, and as befitted one who delighted to be in
fashion, Pepys adopted this wig. He took time to consider the matter, and
had consultations with Mr. Jervas, his old barber, about the affair.
Referring to one of his visits to his hairdresser, Pepys says:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I did try two or three borders and periwigs, meaning to
wear one, and yet I have no stomach for it; but that the pains of keeping
my hair clean is great. He trimmed me, and at last I parted, but my mind
was almost altered from my first purpose, from the trouble which I foresee
in wearing them also.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Weeks passed before he could make up his mind to wear a wig. Mrs. Pepys
was taken to the periwig-maker's shop to see one, and expressed her
satisfaction with it. We read in April, 1665, of the wig being back at
Jervas's under repair. Later, under date of September 3d, he writes:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Lord's day. Up; and put on my coloured silk suit, very
fine, and my new periwig, bought a good while since, but durst not wear,
because the plague was in Westminster when I bought it; and it is a wonder
what will be in fashion, after the plague is done, as to periwigs, for
nobody will dare to buy any hair, for fear of the infection, that it had
been cut off the heads of people dead of the
plague.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>In 1670, only, five years after this entry of Pepys, we find Governor
Barefoot of New Hampshire wearing a periwig; and in 1675 the court of
Massachusetts, in view of the distresses of the Indian wars, denounced the
&quot;manifest pride openly appearing amongst us in that long hair, like
women's hair is worn by some men, either their own hair, or others' hair
made into periwigs.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1676 Wait Winthrop sent a wig (price &pound;3) to his brother in New
London. Mr. Sergeant had brought it from England for his own use; but was
willing to sell it to oblige a friend, who was, I am confident, very
devoted to wig-wearing. The largest wig that I recall upon any colonist's
head is in the portrait of Governor Fitz-John Winthrop. He is painted in
armor; and a great wig never seems so absurd as when worn with armor.
Horace Walpole said, &quot;Perukes of outrageous length flowing over suits
of armour compose wonderful habits.&quot; An edge of Winthrop's own dark
hair seems to show under the wig front. I do not know the precise date of
this portrait. It was, of course, painted in England. He served in the
Parliamentary army with General Monck; returned to New England in 1663, and
was commander of the New England forces. He spent 1693 to l697 in England
as commissioner. Sir Peter Lely and Sir Godfrey Kneller both were painting
in England in those years, and both were constant in painting men with
armor and perukes. This portrait seems like Kneller's work.</p>

<p>Another portrait attired also in armor and peruke is of Sir Nathaniel
Johnson, who was appointed governor of South Carolina by the Lords
Proprietors in 1702. The portrait was painted in 1705. It is one of the few
of that date which show a faint mustache; he likewise wears a seal ring
with coat-of-arms on the little finger of his left hand, which was unusual
at that day. De Bienville, the governor of Louisiana, is likewise in wig
and armor. In 1682 Thomas Richbell died in Boston, leaving a very rich and
costly wardrobe. He had eight wigs. Of these, three were small periwigs
worth but a pound apiece. In New York, in Virginia, in all the colonies,
these wigs were worn, and were just as large and costly, as elaborately
curled, as heavily powdered, as at the English and French courts.</p>

<p>Archbishop Tillotson is usually regarded as the first amongst the
English clergy to adopt the wig. He said in one of his sermons:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I can remember since the wearing of hair below the ears
was looked upon as a sin of the first magnitude, and when ministers
generally, whatever their text was, did either find or make occasion to
reprove the great sin of long hair; and if they saw any one in the
congregation guilty in that kind, they would point him out particularly,
and let fly at him with great zeal.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Tillotson died on November 24, 1694.</p>

<p>Long before that American preachers had felt it necessary to &quot;let
fly&quot; also; to denounce wig-wearing from their pulpits. The question
could not be settled, since the ministers themselves could not agree. John
Wilson, the zealous Boston minister, wore one, and John Cotton (see <a
href="#Reverend_John_Cotton.">here</a>); while Rev. Mr. Noyes preached long
and often against the fashion. John Eliot, the noble preacher and
missionary to the Indians, found time even in the midst of his arduous and
incessant duties to deliver many a blast against &quot;prolix
locks,&quot;--&quot;with boiling zeal,&quot; as Cotton Mather said,--and he
labelled them a &quot;luxurious feminine protexity&quot;; but lamented late
in life that &quot;the lust for wigs is become insuperable.&quot; He
thought the horrors in King Philip's War were a direct punishment from God
for wig-wearing. Increase Mather preached warmly against wigs, calling them
&quot;Horrid Bushes of Vanity,&quot; and saying that &quot;such Apparel is
contrary to the light of Nature, and to express Scripture,&quot; and that
&quot;Monstrous Periwigs such as some of our church members indulge in make
them resemble ye locusts that came out of ye Bottomless Pit.&quot;</p>

<p>Rev. George Weeks preached a sermon on impropriety in clothes. He said
in regard to wig-wearing:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We have no warrant in the word of God, that I know of,
for our wearing of Periwigs except it be in extraordinary cases. Elisha did
not cover his head with a Perriwigg altho' it was bald. To see the greater
part of Men in some congregations wearing Perriwiggs is a matter of deep
lamentation. For either all these men had a necessity to cut off their Hair
or else not. If they had a necessity to cut off their Hair then we have
reason to take up a lamentation over the sin of our first Parents which
hath occasioned so many Persons in our Congregation to be sickly, weakly,
crazy Persons.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Long &quot;Ruffianly&quot; or &quot;Russianly&quot; (I know not which
word is right) hair equally worried the parsons. President Chauncey of
Harvard College preached upon it, for the college undergraduates were
vexingly addicted to prolix locks. Rev. Mr. Wigglesworth's sermon on the
subject has often been reprinted, and is full of logical arguments. This
offence was named on the list of existing evils which was made by the
general court: that &quot;the men wore long hair like women's hair.&quot;
Still, the Puritan magistrates, omnipotent as they were in small things,
did riot dare to force the becurled citizens of the little towns to cut
their long love-locks, though they bribed them to do so. A Salem man was,
in 1687, fined l0s. for a misdemeanor, but &quot;in case he shall cutt off
his long har of his head into a sevill (civil?) frame, in the mean time
shall have abated 5s. of his fine.&quot; John Eliot hated long, natural
hair as well as false hair. Rev. Cotton Mather said of him, in a very
unpleasant figure of speech, &quot;The hair of them that professed religion
grew too long for him to swallow.&quot; His own hair curled on his
shoulders, and would seem long to us to-day.</p>

<p>A climax of wig-hating was reached by one who has been styled &quot;The
Last of the Puritans&quot;--Judge Samuel Sewall of Boston. Constant
references in his diary show how this hatred influenced his daily life. He
despised wigs so long and so deeply, he thought and talked and prayed upon
them, until they became to him of undue importance; they became godless
emblems of iniquity; an unutterable snare and peril.</p>

<p>We find Sewall copying with evident approval a &quot;scandalous
bill&quot; which had been &quot;posted&quot; on the church in Plymouth in
1701. In this a few lines ran:--</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&quot;Our churches are too genteel.<br>
Parsons grow trim and trigg<br>
With wealth, wine, and wigg,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their crowns are covered with meal.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Bitter must have been his efforts to reconcile to his conscience the
sight of wigs upon the heads of his parson friends, worn boldly in the
pulpit. He would refrain from attending a church where the parson wore a
wig; and his italicized praise of a dead friend was that he &quot;was a
true New-English man and <i>abominated periwigs</i>.&quot; A Boston
wig-maker died a drunkard, and Sewall took much melancholy satisfaction in
dilating upon it.</p>

<p>Cotton Mather and Sewall had many pious differences and personal
jealousies. The parson was a handsome man (see his picture <a
href="#Reverend_Cotton_Mather.">here</a>), and he was a harmlessly and
naively vain man. He quickly adopted a &quot;great bush of
vanity&quot;--and a very personable appearance he makes in it. Soon we find
him inveighing at length in the pulpit against &quot;those who strain at a
gnat and swallow a camel, those who were zealous against an innocent
fashion taken up and used by the best of men.&quot; &quot;'Tis supposed he
means wearing a Perriwigg,&quot; writes Sewall after this sermon; &quot;I
expected not to hear a vindication of Perriwiggs in Boston pulpit by Mr.
Mather.&quot;</p>

<p>Poor Sewall! his regard of wigs had a severe test when he wooed Madam
Winthrop late in life. She was a rich widow. He had courted her vainly for
a second wife. And now he &quot;yearned for her deeply&quot; for a third
wife, so he wrote. And ere she would consent or even discuss marriage she
stipulated two things: one, that he keep a coach; the other, that he wear a
periwig. When all the men of dignity and office in the colony were
bourgeoning out in great flowing perukes, she was naturally a bit averse to
an elderly lover in a skullcap or, as he often wore, a hood. His love did
not make him waver; he stoutly persisted in his refusal to assume a
periwig.</p>

<p>His portrait in a velvet skullcap shows a fringe of white curling hair
with a few forehead locks. I fancy he was bald. Here is his entry with
regard to young Parson Willard's wig, in the year 1701:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Having last night heard that Josiah Willard had cut off
his hair (a very full head of hair) and put on a wig, I went to him this
morning. When I told his mother what I came about, she called him.
Whereupon I inquired of him what extreme need had forced him to put off
his own hair and put on a wig? He answered, none at all; he said that his
hair was straight, and that it parted behind.<br> <br> &quot;He seemed to
argue that men might as well shave their hair off their head, as off their
face. I answered that boys grew to be men before they had hair on their
faces, and that half of mankind never have any beards. I told him that God
seems to have created our hair as a test, to see whether we can bring our
minds to be content at what he gives us, or whether wewould be our own
carvers and come back to him for nothing more. We might dislike our skin
or nails, as he disliked his hair; but in our case no thanks are due to us
that we cut them not off; for pain and danger restrain us. Your duty, said
I, is to teach men self-denial. I told him, further, that it would be
displeasing and burdensome to good men for him to wear a wig, and they
that care not what men think of them, care not what God thinks of
them.<br> <br> &quot;I told him that he must remember that wigs were
condemned by a meeting of ministers at Northampton. I told him of the
solemnity of the covenant which he and I had lately entered into, which
put upon me the duty of discoursing to him.<br> <br> &quot;He seemed to
say that he would leave off his wig when his hair was grown again. I spoke
to his father of it a day or two afterwards and he thanked me for
reasoning with his son.<br> <br> &quot;He told me his son had promised to
leave off his wig when his hair was grown to cover his ears. If the father
had known of it, he would have forbidden him to cut off his hair. His
mother heard him talk of it, but was afraid to forbid him for fear he
should do it in spite of her, and so be more faulty than if she had let
him go his own way.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Soon nearly every parson in England and every colony wore wigs. John
Wesley alone wore what seems to be his own white hair curled under softly
at the ends. Whitfield is in a portentous wig like the one on Dr. Marsh <a
href="#Reverend_John_Marsh.">(here</a>).</p>

<p>In the time of Queen Anne, wigs had multiplied vastly in variety as they
had increased in size. I have been asked the difference between a peruke
and a wig. Of course both, and the periwig, are simply wigs; but the term
&quot;peruke&quot; is in general applied to a formal, richly curled wig;
and the word &quot;periwig&quot; also conveys the distinction of a formal
wig. Of less dignity were riding-wigs, nightcap wigs, and bag-wigs.
Bag-wigs are said to have had their origin among French servants, who tied
up their hair in a black leather bag as a speedy way of dressing it, and to
keep it out of the way when at other and disordering duties.</p>

<p>In May, 1706, the English, led by Marlborough, gained a great victory on
the battle-field of Ramillies, and that gave the title to a new wig
described as &quot;having a long, gradually diminishing, plaited tail,
called the 'Ramillie-tail,' which was tied with a great bow at the top and
a smaller one at the bottom.&quot; The hair also bushed out at both sides
of the face. The Ramillies wig shown in Hogarth's <i>Modern Midnight
Conversation</i> hanging against the wall, is reproduced <a
href="#Campaign,_Ramillies,_Bob,_and_Pigtail_Wigs.">here</a>. This wig was
not at first deemed full-dress. Queen Anne was deeply offended because Lord
Bolingbroke, summoned hurriedly to her, appeared in a Ramillies wig instead
of a full-bottomed peruke. The queen remarked that she supposed next time
Lord Bolingbroke would come in his nightcap. It was the same offending
nobleman who brought in the fashion of the mean little tie-wigs.</p>

<p>It is stated in Read's <i>Weekly Journal</i> of May 1, 1736, in an
account of the marriage of the Prince of Wales, that the officers of the
Horse and Foot Guards wore Ramillies periwigs when on parade, by his
Majesty's order. We meet in the reign of George II other forms of wigs and
other titles; the most popular was the pigtail wig. The pigtail of this was
worn hanging down the back or tied up in a knot behind. This pigtail wig,
worn for so many years, is shown <a
href="#Campaign,_Ramillies,_Bob,_and_Pigtail_Wigs.">here</a>. It was
popular in the army for sixty years, but in 1804 orders were given for the
pigtail to be reduced to seven inches in length, and finally, in 1808, to
be cut off wholly, to the deep mourning of disciplinarians who deemed a
soldier without a pigtail as hopeless as a Manx cat.</p>

<p>Bob-wigs, minor and major, came in during the reign of George II. The
bob-wig was held to be a direct imitation of the natural hair, though, of
course, it deceived no one; it was used chiefly by poorer folk. The
'prentice minor bob was close and short, the citizen's bob major, or Sunday
buckle, had several rows of curls. All these came to America by the
hundreds--yes, by the thousands. Every profession and almost every calling
had its peculiar wig. The caricatures of the period represent full-fledged
lawyers with a towering frontlet and a long bag at the back tied in the
middle; while students of the university have a wig flat on the top, to
accommodate their stiff, square-cornered hats, and a great bag like a
lawyer's wig at the back.</p>

<p>&quot;When the law lays down its full-bottom'd periwig you will find
less wisdom in bald pates than you are aware of,&quot; says the <i>Choleric
Man</i>. This lawyer's wig is the only one which has not been changed or
abandoned. You may see it here, on the head of Judge Benjamin Lynde of
Salem. He died in 1745. Carlyle sneers:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Has not your Red hanging-individual a horsehair wig,
squirrel-skins, and a plush-gown--whereby all Mortals know that he is a
JUDGE?&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>In the reigns of Anne and William and Mary perukes grew so vast and
cumbersome that a wig was invented for travelling and for undress wear, and
was called the &quot;Campaign wig.&quot; It would not seem very simple
since it was made full and curled to the front, and had, so writes a
contemporary, Randle Holme, in his <i>Academy of Armory</i>, 1684,
&quot;knots and bobs a-dildo on each side and a curled forehead.&quot;</p>

<p>A campaign wig from Holme's drawing is shown <a
href="#Campaign,_Ramillies,_Bob,_and_Pigtail_Wigs.">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are constant references in old letters and in early literature in
America which alter much the dates assigned by English authorities on
costume: thus, knowing not of Randle Holme's drawing, Sydney writes that
the name &quot;campaign&quot; was applied to a wig, the name and fashion of
which came to England from France in 1702. In the Letter-book of William
Byrd of Westover, Virginia, in a letter written in June, 1690, to Perry and
Lane, his English factors in London, he says, &quot;I have by Tonner sent
my long Periwig which I desire you to get made into a Campagne and send
mee.&quot; This was twelve years earlier than Sydney's date. Fitz-John
Winthrop wrote to England in 1695 for &quot;two wiggs one a campane the
other short.&quot; The portrait of Fitz-John Winthrop shows a prodigious
imposing wig, but it has no &quot;knots or bobs a-dildo on each side,&quot;
though the forehead is curled; it is a fine example of a peruke.</p>

<p>I cannot attempt even to name all the wigs, much less can I describe
them; Hawthorne gave &quot;the tie,&quot; the &quot;Brigadier,&quot; the
&quot;Major,&quot; the &quot;Ramillies,&quot; the grave
&quot;Full-bottom,&quot; the giddy &quot;Feather-top.&quot; To these and
others already named in this chapter I can add the &quot;Neck-lock,&quot;
the &quot;Allonge,&quot; the &quot;Lavant,&quot; the &quot;Vallancy,&quot;
the &quot;Grecian fly wig,&quot; the &quot;Beau-peruke,&quot; the
&quot;Long-tail,&quot; the &quot;Fox-tail,&quot; the &quot;Cut-wig,&quot;
the &quot;Scratch,&quot; the &quot;Twist-wig.&quot;</p>

<p>Others named in 1753 in the <i>London Magazine</i> were the &quot;Royal
bird,&quot; the &quot;Rhinoceros,&quot; the &quot;Corded Wolf's-paw,&quot;
&quot;Count Saxe's mode,&quot; the &quot;She-dragon,&quot; the
&quot;Jansenist,&quot; the &quot;Wild-boar's-back,&quot; the
&quot;Snail-back,&quot; the &quot;Spinach-seed.&quot; These titles were
literal translations of French wig-names.</p>

<p>Another wig-name was the &quot;Gregorian.&quot; We read in <i>The Honest
Ghost</i>, 1658, &quot;Pulling a little down his Gregorian, which was
displac't a little by his hastie taking off his beaver.&quot; This wig was
named from the inventor, one Gregory, &quot;the famous peruke-maker who is
buryed at St. Clements Danes Church.&quot; In Cotgrave's <i>Dictionary</i>
perukes are called Gregorians.</p>

<p>In the prologue to <i>Haut Ton</i>, written by George Colman, these wigs
are named:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The Tyburn scratch, thick Club and Temple tyes,<br>
The Parson's Feather-top, frizzed, broad and high.<br>
The coachman's Cauliflower, built tier on tier.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>There was also the &quot;Minister's bob,&quot; &quot;Curley roys,&quot;
&quot;Airy levants,&quot; and &quot;I--perukes.&quot; The
&quot;Dalmahoy&quot; was a bushy bob-wig.</p>

<p>When Colonel John Carter died, he left to his brother Robert his cane,
sword, and periwig. I believe this to be the very Valiancy periwig which,
in all its snowy whiteness and air of extreme fashion, graces the head of
the handsome young fellow as he is shown <a
href="#&quot;King&quot;_Carter_in_Youth,_by_Sir_Godfrey_Kneller.">here</a>.
Even the portrait shares the fascination which the man is said to have had
for every woman. I have a copy of it now standing on my desk, where I can
glance at him as I write; and pleasant company have I found the gay young
Virginian--the best of company. It is good to have a companion so handsome
of feature, so personable of figure, so laughing, care free, and
debonair--isn't it, King Robert?</p>

<p>These snowy wigs at a later date were called Adonis wigs.</p>

<p>The cost of a handsome wig would sometimes amount to thirty, forty, and
fifty guineas, though Swift grumbled at paying three guineas, and the
exceedingly correct Mr. Pepys bought wigs at two and three pounds. It is
not strange that they were often stolen. Gay, in his <i>Trivia</i>, thus
tells the manner of their disappearance:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Nor is the flaxen wig with safety worn;<br>
&nbsp;High on the shoulder, in a basket borne,<br>
&nbsp;Lurks the sly boy, whose hand to rapine bred,<br>
&nbsp;Plucks off the curling honors of the head.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>In America wigs were deemed rich spoils for the sneak-thief.</p>

<p>There was a vast trade in second-hand wigs. 'Tis said there was in
Rosemary Lane in London a constantly replenished &quot;Wig lottery.&quot;
It was, rather, a wig grab-bag. The wreck of gentility paid his last
sixpence for appearances, dipped a long arm into a hole in a cask, and
fished out his wig. It might be half-decent, or it might be fit only to
polish shoes--worse yet, it might have been used already for that purpose.
The lowest depths of everything were found in London. I doubt if we had any
Rosemary Lane wig lotteries in New York, or Philadelphia, or Boston.</p>

<p>An answer to a query in a modern newspaper gives the word
&quot;caxon&quot; as descriptive of a dress-wig. It was in truth a term for
a wig, but it was a cant term, a slang phrase for the worst possible wig;
thus Charles Lamb Wrote:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;He had two wigs both pedantic but of different omen. The
one serene, smiling, fresh-powdered, betokening a mild day. The other an
old discoloured, unkempt, angry caxon denoting frequent and bloody
execution.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>All these wigs, even the bob-wig, were openly artificial. The manner of
their make, their bindings, their fastening, as well as their material,
completely destroyed any illusion which could possibly have been
entertained as to their being a luxuriant crop of natural hair.</p>

<p>No one was ashamed of wearing a wig. On the contrary, a person with any
sense of dignity was ashamed of being so unfashionable as to wear his own
hair. It was a glorious time for those to whom Nature had been niggardly. A
wig was as frankly extraneous as a hat. No attempt was made to imitate the
roots of the hairs, or the parting. The hair was attached openly, and bound
with a high-colored, narrow ribbon. Here is an advertisement from the
<i>Boston News Letter</i> of August 14, 1729:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Taken from the shop of Powers Mariott, Barber, a light
Flaxen Natural Wigg parted from the forehead to the Crown. The Narrow
Ribband is of a Red Pink Color, the Caul is in rows of Red, Green and
White Ribband.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Another &quot;peruke-maker&quot; lost a Flaxen &quot;Natural&quot; wig
bound with peach-colored ribbon; while in 1755 Barber Coes, of Marblehead,
lost &quot;feather-tops&quot; bound with various ribbons. Some had three
colors on one wig--pink, green and purple. A goat's-hair wig bound with red
and purple, with green ribbons striping the caul, must have been a pretty
and dignified thing on an old gentleman's head. One of the most curious
materials for a wig was fine wire, of which Wortley Montague's wig was
made.</p>

<p>We read in many histories of costume, among them Miss Hill's recent
history of English dress, that Quakers did not wear wigs. This is widely
incorrect. Many Quakers wore most fashionably made wigs. William Penn wrote
from England to his steward, telling him to allow Deputy Governor Lloyd to
wear his (Penn's) wigs. I suppose he wished his deputy to cut a good
figure.</p>

<p>From the <i>New York Gazette</i> of May 9, 1737, we learn of a thief's
stealing &quot;one gray Hair Wig, not the worse for wearing, one Pale Hair
Wig, not worn five times, marked V. S. E., one brown Natural wig, One old
wig of goat's hair put in buckle.&quot; Buckle meant to curl, and
derivatively a wig was in buckle when it was rolled for curling. Roulettes
or bilbouquettes for buckling a wig were little rollers of pipe clay. The
hair was twisted up in them, and papers bound over them to fix them in
place. The roulettes could be put in buckle hot, or they could be rolled
cold and the whole wig heated. The latter was not favored; it damaged the
wig. Moreover, a careless barber had often roasted a forgotten wig which he
had put in buckle and in an oven.</p>

<p>The <i>New York Gazette</i> of May 12, 1750, had this alluring
advertisement:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;This is to acquaint the Public, that there is lately
arrived from London the Wonder of the World, <i>an Honest</i> Barber and
Peruke Maker, who might have worked for the King, if his Majesty would
have employed him: It was not for the want of Money he came here, for he
had enough of that at Home, nor for the want of Business, that he
advertises himself, BUT to acquaint the Gentlemen and Ladies, that <i>Such

<p>&quot;Perukes,&quot; says Malcolm, in his <i>Manners and Customs</i>,
&quot;were an highly important article in 1734.&quot; Those of right gray
human hair were four guineas each; light grizzle ties, three guineas; and
other colors in proportion, to twenty-five shillings. Right gray human hair
cue perukes, from two guineas to fifteen shillings each, was the price of
dark ones; and right gray bob perukes, two guineas and a half to fifteen
shillings, the price of dark bobs. Those mixed with horsehair were much
lower.</p>

<p>Prices were a bit higher in America. It was held that better wigs were
made in England than in America or France; so the letter-books and
agent's-lists of American merchants are filled with orders for English
wigs.</p>

<p>Imperative orders for the earliest and extremest new fashions stood from
year to year on the lists of fashionable London wig-makers; and these
constant orders came from Virginia gentlemen and Massachusetts
magistrates,--not a few, too, from the parsons,--scantly paid as they were.
The smaller bob-wigs and tie-wigs were precisely the same in both
countries, and I am sure were no later in assumption in America than was
necessitated by the weeks occupied in coming across seas.</p>

<p>Throughout the seventeenth century all classes of men in American towns
wore wigs. Negro slaves flaunted white horsehair wigs, goat's-hair
bob-wigs, natural wigs, all the plainer wigs, and all the more costly sorts
when these were half worn and secondhand. Soldiers wore wigs; and in the
<i>Massachusetts Gazette</i> of the year 1774 a runaway negro is described
as wearing a curl of hair tied around his head to imitate a scratch wig;
with his woolly crown this dangling curl must have been the height of
absurdity.</p>

<p>It is not surprising to find in the formal life of the English court the
poor little tormented, sickly, sad child of Queen Anne wearing, before he
was seven years old, a large full-bottomed wig; but it is curious to see
the portraits of American children rigged up in wigs (I have half a dozen
such), and to find likewise an American gentleman (and not one of wealth
either) paying &pound;9 apiece for wigs for three little sons of seven,
nine, and eleven years of age. This lavish parent was Enoch Freeman, who
lived in Portland, Maine, in 1754.</p>

<p>Wigs were objects of much and constant solicitude and care; their
dressing was costly, and they wore out readily. Barbers cared for them by
the month or year, visiting from house to house. Ten pounds a year was not
a large sum to be paid for the care of a single wig. Men of dignity and
careful dress had barbers' bills of large amount, such men as Governor John
Hancock, Governor Hutchinson, and Governor Belcher. On Saturday afternoons
the barbers' boys were seen flying through the narrow streets, wig-box in
hand, hurrying to deliver all the dressed wigs ere sunset came.</p>

<p>No doubt the constant wearing of such hot, heavy head-covering made the
hair thin and the head bald; thus wigs became a necessity. Men had their
heads very closely covered of old, and caught cold at a breath. Pepys took
cold throwing off his hat while at dinner. If the wig were removed even
within doors a close cap or hood at once took its place, or, as I tell
elsewhere, a turban of some rich stuff. In America, in the Southern states,
where people were poor and plantations scattered, all men did not wear
wigs. A writer in the <i>London Magazine</i> in 1745 tells of this country
carelessness of dress. He says that except some of the &quot;very Elevated
Sort&quot; few wore perukes; so that at first sight &quot;all looked as if
about to go to bed,&quot; for all wore caps. Common people wore woollen
caps; richer ones donned caps of white cotton or Holland linen. These were
worn even when riding fifty miles from home. He adds, &quot;It may be
cooler for aught I know; but methinks 'tis very ridiculous.&quot; So wonted
were his eyes to perukes, that his only thought of caps was that they were
&quot;ridiculous.&quot; Nevertheless, when a shipload of servants,
bond-servants who might be stolen when in drink, or lured under false
pretences, might be convicts, or honest workmen,--when these transports
were set up in respectability,--scores of new wigs of varying degrees of
dignity came across seas with them. Many an old caxon or
&quot;gossoon&quot;--a wig worn yellow with age--ended its days on the pate
of a redemptioner, who thereby acquired dignity and was more likely to be
bought as a schoolmaster. Truly our ancestors were not squeamish, and it is
well they were not, else they would have squeamed from morning till night
at the sights, and sounds, and things, and dirt around them. But these be
parlous words; they had the senses and feelings of their day--suited to the
surroundings of their day. In one thing they can be envied. Knowing not of
germs and microbes, dreaming not of antiseptics and fumigation, they could
be happy in blissful unconsciousness of menacing environment--a blessing
wholly denied to us.</p>

<p>When James Murray came from Scotland in 1735 he went up the Cape Fear
River in North Carolina to the struggling settlements of Brunswick. The
stock of wigs which he brought as one of the commodities of his trade had
absolutely no market. In 1751 he wrote thus to his London wig-maker:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We deal so much in caps in this country that we are
almost as careless of the outside as of the inside of our heads. I have
had but one wig since the last I had of you, and yours has outworn it.
Now I am near out, and you may make me a new grisel
Bob.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, in 1769, when he was roughly handled in Boston on account
of his Tory utterances, his head, though he was but fifty-six, was bald
from wig-wearing. His spirited recital runs thus:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The crowd intending sport, remained. As I was pressing
out, my Wig was pulled off and a pate shaved by Time and the barber was
left exposed. This was thought a signal and prelude to further insult;
which would probably have taken place but for hindering the cause. Going
along in this plight, surrounded by the crowd, in the dark, a friend hold
of either arm supporting me, while somebody behind kept nibbling at my
sides and endeavouring of treading the reforming justice out of me by the
multitude. My wig dishevelled, was borne on a staff behind. My friends and
supporters offered to house me, but I insisted on going home in the
present trim, and was landed in safety.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Patriotic Boston barbers found much satisfaction in ill treating the
wigs of their Tory customers and patrons. William Pyncheon, a Salem Tory,
wrote a few years later:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The tailors and barbers, in their squinting and fleering
at our clothes, and especially our wiggs, begin to border on malevolence.
Had not the caul of my wigg been of uncommon stuff and workmanship, I think
my barber would have had it in pieces: his dressing it greatly resembles
the farmer dressing his flax, the latter of the two being the gentlest in
his motions.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Worcester Tories, among them Timothy Paine, had their wigs pulled off in
public. Mr. Paine at once gave his dishonored wig to one of his negro
slaves, and never after resumed wig-wearing.</p>

alt="M">en's hair on their heads hath ever been at odds with that on their
face. If the head were well covered and the hair long, then the face was
smooth shaven. William the Conqueror had short hair and a beard, then came
a long-haired king, then a cropped one; Edward IV's subjects had long hair
and closely cut beards. Henry VII fiercely forbade beards. The great
sovereign Henry VIII ordered short hair like the French, and wore a beard.
Through Elizabeth's day and that of James the beard continued. Not until
great perukes overshadowed the whole face did the beard disappear. It
vanished for a century as if men were beardless; but after men began to
wear short hair in the early years of the nineteenth century, bearded men
appeared. A few German mystics who had come to America full-bearded were
stared at like the elephant, and a sight of them was recorded in a diary as
a great event.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that, to the general reader, the ordinary thought of
the Puritan is with a beard, a face and figure much like the Hogarth
illustrations of Hudibras--one of the &quot;Presbyterian true Blue,&quot;
&quot;the stubborn crew of Errant Saints,&quot;--without the grotesquery of
face and feature, perhaps, but certainly with all the plainness and
gracelessness of dress and the commonplace beard. The wording of Hudibras
also figures the popular conception:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;His tawny Beard was th' equal Grace<br>
Both of his Wisdom and his Face:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>
&quot;His Doublet was of sturdy Buff<br>
And tho' not Sword, was Cudgel-Proof.<br>
His Breeches were of rugged Woolen<br>
And had been at the Siege of Bullen.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>In truth this is well enough as far as it runs and for one suit of
clothing; but this was by no means a universal dress, nor was it a
universal beard. Indeed beards were fearfully and wonderfully varied.</p>

<p>That humorous old rhymester, Taylor, the &quot;Water Poet,&quot; may be
quoted at length on the vanity thus:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;And Some, to set their Love's-Desire on Edge<br>
Are cut and prun'd, like to a Quickset Hedge.<br>
Some like a Spade, some like a Forke, some square,<br>

<p>Taylor's own beard was screw-shaped. I fancy he invented it.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon beard was parted, and this double form remained for a
long time. Sometimes there were two twists or two long forks.</p>

<p>A curious pointed beard, a beard in two curls, is shown <a
href="#James_Douglas_(Earl_of_Morton).">here</a>, on James Douglas, Earl of
Morton. A still more strangely kept one, pointed in the middle of the chin,
and kept in two rolls which roll toward the front, is upon the aged herald,
<a href="#The_Herald_Vandum.">here</a>.</p>

<p>Richard II had a mean beard,--two little tufts on the chin known as
&quot;the mouse-eaten beard, here a tuft, there a tuft.&quot; The round
beard &quot;like a half a Holland cheese&quot; is always seen in the
depictions of Falstaff; &quot;a great round beard&quot; we know he had.
This was easily trimmed, but others took so much time and attention that
pasteboard boxes were made to tie over them at night, that they might be
unrumpled in the morning.</p>

<p>In the reign of Elizabeth and of James I a beard and whiskers or
mustache were universally worn. In the time of Charles I the general effect
of beard and mustache was triangular, with the mouth in the centre, as in
the portrait of Waller <a href="#Sir_William_Waller.">here</a>.</p>

<p>A beard of some form was certainly universal in 1620. Often it was the
orderly natural growth shown on Winthrop's face; a smaller tuft on the chin
with a mustache also was much worn. Many ministers in America had this
chin-tuft. Among them were John Eliot and John Davenport. The Stuarts wore
a pointed beard, carefully trimmed, and a mustache; but the natural beard
seems to have disappeared with the ruff. Charles II clung for a time to a
mustache; his portrait by Mary Beale has one; but with the great
development of the periwig came a smooth face. This continued until the
nineteenth century brought a fashion of bearded men again; a fashion which
was so abhorred, so reviled, so openly warred with that I know of the
bequest of a large estate with the absolute and irrevocable condition that
the inheritor should never wear a beard of any form.</p>

<p>The hammer cut was of the reign of Charles I. It was T-shaped. In the
play, <i>The Queen of Corinth</i>, 1647, are the lines:--</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He strokes his beard<br>
Which now he puts in the posture of a T,<br>
The Roman T. Your T-beard is in fashion.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>The spade beard is shown <a href="#Scotch_Beard.">here</a>. It was
called the &quot;broad pendant,&quot; and was held to make a man look like
a warrior. The sugar-loaf beard was the natural form much worn by Puritans;
by natural I mean not twisted into any &quot;strange antic forms.&quot; The
swallow-tail cut (about 1600) is more unusual, but was occasionally
seen.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The stiletto-beard<br>
It makes me afeard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so sharp beneath.<br>
For he that doth place<br>
A dagger in his face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What wears he in his sheath?&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>An unusually fine stiletto beard is on the chin of John Endicott (<a
href="#Governor_John_Endicott">here</a>). It was distinctly a soldier's
beard. Endicott was major-general of the colonial forces and a severe
disciplinarian. Shakespere, in <i>Henry V</i>, speaks of &quot;a beard of
the General's cut.&quot; It was worn by the Earl of Southampton (see <a
href="#Earl_of_Southampton.">here</a>), and perhaps Endicott favored it on
that account. The pique-devant beard or &quot;pick-a-devant beard, O Fine
Fashion,&quot; was much worn. A good moderate example may be seen upon
Cousin Kilvert, with doublet and band, in the print <a
href="#Alderman_Abell_and_Richard_Kilvert">here</a>. An extreme type was
the beard of Robert Greene, the Elizabethan dramatist, &quot;A jolly long
red peake like the spire of a steeple, which he wore continually, whereat a
man might hang a jewell; it was so sharp and pendent.&quot;</p>

<p>The word &quot;peak&quot; was constantly used for a beard, and also the
words &quot;spike&quot; and &quot;spear.&quot; A barber is represented in
an old play as asking whether his customer will &quot;have his peak cut
short and sharp; or amiable like an inamorato, or broad pendant like a
spade; to be terrible like a warrior and a soldado; to have his appendices
primed, or his mustachios fostered to turn about his eares like ye branches
of a vine.&quot;</p>

<p>A broad square-cut beard spreading at the ends like an open fan is the
&quot;cathedral beard&quot; of Randle Holme, &quot;so called because grave
men of the church did wear it.&quot; It is often seen in portraits. One of
these is shown <a

<p>In the <i>Life of Mrs. Elizabeth Thomas</i>, 1731, she writes of her
grandfather, a Turkey-merchant:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;He was very nice in the Mode of his Age--his Valet being
some hours every morning in <i>Starching</i> his <i>Beard</i> and Curling
his Whiskers during which Time a Gentleman whom he maintained as Companion
always read to him upon some useful subject.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>So we may believe they really &quot;starched&quot; their beards,
stiffened them with some dressing. Taylor, the &quot;Water Poet&quot;
(1640), says of beards:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Some seem as they were starched stiff and fine<br>
Like to the Bristles of some Angry Swine.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<br><br>

<p>Dr. Dee's extraordinary beard I can but regard as an affectation of
singularity, assumed doubtless to attract attention, and to be a sign of
unusual parts. Aubrey, his friend, calls him &quot;a very handsome man; of
very fair, clear, sanguine complexion, with a long beard as white as milke.
He was tall and slender. He wore a gowne like an artist's gowne; with
hanging sleeves and a slitt. A mighty good man he was.&quot; The word
&quot;artist&quot; then meant artisan; and in this reference means a smock
like a workman's.</p>

<p>A name seen often in Winthrop's letters is that of Sir Kenelm Digby. He
was an intimate correspondent of John Winthrop the second, and it would not
be strange if he did many errands for Winthrop in England besides
purchasing drugs. His portrait, and a lugubrious one it is, is one of the
few of his day which shows an untrimmed beard. Aubrey says of him that
after the death of his wife he wore &quot;a long mourning cloak, a high
cornered hatt, his beard unshorn, look't like a hermit; as signs of sorrow
for his beloved wife. He had something of the sweetness of his mother's
face.&quot; This sweetness is, however, not to be perceived in his
unattractive portrait.</p>

alt="W">hen this old pigskin trunk was new, the men who fought in the
Revolution were young. Here is the date, &quot;1756,&quot; and the initials
in brass-headed nails, &quot;J.E.H.&quot; It was a bride's trunk, the trunk
of Elizabeth, who married John; and it was marked after the manner of
marking the belongings of married folk in her day. It is curious in shape,
spreading out wide at the top; for it was made to fit a special place in an
old coach. I have told the story of that ancient coach in my <i>Old
Narragansett</i>: the tale of the ignoble end of its days, the account of
its fall from transportation of this happy bride and bridegroom, through
years of stately use and formal dignity to more years of happy desuetude as
a children's cubby-house; and finally its ignominy as a roosting-place, and
hiding-place, and laying-place, and setting-place of misinformed and
misguided hens. Under the coachman's seat, where the two-score dark-blue
Staffordshire pie-plates were found on the day of the annihilation of the
coach, was the true resting-place of this trunk. It was a hidden spot, for
the trunk was small, and was intended to hold only treasures. It holds them
still, though they are not the silver-plate, the round watches, the narrow
laces, and the precious camel's-hair scarf. It now holds treasured relics
of the olden time; trifles, but not unconsidered ones; much esteemed
trifles are they, albeit not in form or shape or manner of being fit to
rest in parlor cabinets or on tables, but valued, nevertheless, valued for
that most intangible of qualities--association.</p>

<p>Here is one little &quot;antick.&quot; It is an ample bag with the neat
double drawing-strings of our youth; a bag, nay, a pocket. It once hung by
the side of some one of my forbears, perhaps Elizabeth of the brass-nailed
initials. It was a much-esteemed pocket, though it is only of figured
cotton or chiney; but those stuffs were much sought after when this old
trunk was new. The pocket has served during recent years as a cover for two
articles of footwear which many &quot;of the younger sort&quot; to-day have
never seen--they are pattens. &quot;Clumsy, ugly pattens&quot; we find them
frequently stigmatized in the severe words of the early years of the
nineteenth century, but there is nothing ugly or clumsy about this pair.
The sole is of some black, polished wood--it is heavy enough for ebony; the
straps are of strong leather neatly stitched; the buckles are polished
brass, and brass nails fasten the leather to the wooden soles. These soles
are cut up high in a ridge to fit under the instep of a high-heeled shoe;
for it was a very little lady who wore these pattens,--Elizabeth,--and her
little feet always stood in the highest heels. She was active, kindly, and
bountiful. She lived to great age, and she could and did walk many miles a
day until the last year of her life. She is recalled as wearing a great
scarlet cloak with a black silk quilted hood on cold winter days, when she
visited her neighbors with kindly words, and housewifely, homely gifts,
conveyed in an ample basket. The cloak was made precisely like the scarlet
cloak shown <a href="#Scarlet_Broadcloth_Hooded_Cloak.">here</a>, and had a
like hood. She was brown-eyed, and her dark hair was never gray even in
extreme old age; nor was the hair of her granddaughter, another Elizabeth,
my grandmother. Trim and erect of figure, and precise and neat of dress,
wearing, on account of this neatness, shorter petticoats, when walking,
than was the mode of her day, and also through this neatness clinging to
the very last to these cleanly, useful, quaint pattens. Her black hood,
frilled white cap, short, quilted petticoat, high-heeled shoes, and the
shining ebony and brass pattens, and over all the great, full scarlet
cloak,--all these made her an unusual and striking figure against the
Wayland landscape, the snowy fields and great sombre pine trees of Heard's
Island, as she trod trimly, in short pattened steps that crackled the
kittly-benders in the shadowed roads, or sunk softly in the shallow mud of
the sunny lanes on a snow-melting day in late winter. Would I could paint
the picture as I see it!</p>

<p>These pattens in the old trunk are prettier than most pattens which have
been preserved. In general, they are rather shabby things. I have another
pair--more commonplace, which chance to exist; they were not saved
purposely. They are pictured <a

<p>There is a most ungallant old riddle, &quot;Why is a wife like a
patten?&quot; The answer reads, &quot;Because both are clogs.&quot; A very
courteous bishop was once asked this uncivil query, and he answered without
a moment's hesitation, &quot;Because both elevate the soul (sole).&quot;
Pattens may be clogs, yet there is a difference. After much consultation of
various authorities, and much discussion in the columns of various querying
journals, I make this decision and definition. Pattens are thick, wooden
soles roughly shaped in the outline of the human foot (in the shoemaker's
notion of that member), mounted on a round or oval ring of iron, fixed by
two or three pins to the sole, in such a way that when the patten is worn
the sole of the wearer's foot is about two inches above the ground. A
heel-piece with buckles and straps, strings or buttons and leather loops,
and a strap over the toe, retain the patten in place upon the foot when the
wearer trips along. (See <a
href="#Iron_and_Leather_Pattens._1760.">here</a>.) Clogs serve the same
purpose, but are simply wooden soles tipped and shod with iron. These also
have heel-pieces and straps of various materials--from the heavy
serviceable leather shown in the clogs <a
href="#Oak,_Iron,_and_Leather_Clogs._1790.">here</a> and <a
href="#English_Clogs.">here</a> to the fine brocade clogs made and worn by
two brides and pictured <a
href="#Brides'_Clogs_of_Brocade_and_Sole_Leather.">here</a>. Dainty brass
tips and colored morocco straps made a really refined pair of clogs. Poplar
wood was deemed the best wood for pattens and clogs. Sometimes the wooden
sole was thin, and was cut at the line under the instep in two pieces and
hinged. These hinges were held to facilitate walking. Children also wore
clogs. (See <a href="#Children's_Clogs._1730.">here</a>.) Clogs, as worn by
English and American folk, did not raise the wearer as high above the mud
and mire as did pattens, but I have seen Turkish clogs that were ten inches
high. Chopines were worn by Englishwomen to make them look taller. Three
are shown <a href="#Chopines,_Seventeenth_Century">here</a>. Lady Falkland
was short and stout, and wore them for years to increase her apparent
height; so she states in her memoirs.</p>

<p>It is a curious philological study that, while the words
&quot;clogs&quot; and &quot;pattens&quot; for a time were constantly heard,
the third name which has survived till to-day is the oldest of
all--&quot;galoshes.&quot; Under the many spellings, galoe-shoes, goloshes,
gallage, galoche, and gallosh, it has come down to us from the Middle Ages.
It is spelt galoches in <i>Piers Plowman</i>. In a <i>Compotus</i>--or
household account of the Countess of Derby in 1388 are entries of botews
(boots), souters (slippers), and &quot;one pair of galoches, 14 d.&quot;
Clogs, or galoches, were known in the days of the Saxons, when they were
termed &quot;wife's shoes.&quot;</p>

<p>A &quot;galage&quot; was a shoe &quot;which has nothing on the feet but
a latchet&quot;; it was simply a clog. In February, 1687, Judge Sewall
notes, &quot;Send my mothers Shoes &amp; Golowshoes to carry to her.&quot;
In 1736 Peter Faneuil sent to England for &quot;Galoushoes&quot; for his
sister. Another foot-covering for slippery, icy walking is named by Judge
Sewall. He wrote on January 19, 1717, &quot;Great rain and very Slippery;
was fain to wear Frosts.&quot; These frosts were what had been called on
horses, &quot;frost nails,&quot; or calks. They were simply spiked soles to
help the wearer to walk on ice. A pair may be seen at the Deerfield
Memorial Hall. Another pair is of half-soles with sharp ridges of iron,
set, one the length of the half-sole, the other across it.</p>

<p>For a time clogs seem to have been in constant use in America; frail
morocco slippers and thin prunella and callimanco shoes made them
necessary, as did also the unpaved streets. Heavy-soled shoes were unknown
for women's wear. Women walked but short distances. In the country they
always rode. We find even Quaker women warned in 1720 not to wear
&quot;Shoes of light Colours bound with Differing Colours, and heels White
or Red, with White bands, and fine Coloured Clogs and Strings, and Scarlet
and Purple Stockings and Petticoats made Short to expose them&quot;--a
rather startling description of footwear. Again, in 1726, in Burlington,
New Jersey, Friends were asked to be &quot;careful to avoid wearing of
Stript Shoos, or Red and White Heel'd Shoos, or Clogs, or Shoos trimmed
with Gawdy Colours.&quot;</p>

<p>Ann Warder, an English Quaker, was in Philadelphia, 1786 to 1789, and
kept an entertaining journal, from which I make this quotation:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Got B. Parker to go out shopping with me. On our way
happened of Uncle Head, to whom I complained bitterly of the dirty
streets, declaring if I could purchase a pair of pattens, the singularity
I would not mind. Uncle soon found me up an apartment, out of which I
took a pair and trotted along quite Comfortable, crossing some streets
with the greatest ease, which the idea of had troubled me. My little
companion was so pleased, that she wished some also, and kept them on her
feet to learn to walk in them most of the remainder of the
day.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Fairholt, in his book upon costume, says, &quot;Pattens date their
origin to the reign of Anne.&quot; Like many other dates and statements
given by this author, this is wholly wrong. In <i>Purchas', his
Pilgrimage</i>, 1613, is this sentence, &quot;Clogges or Pattens to keep
them out of the dust they may not burden themselves with,&quot; showing
that the name and thing was the same then as to-day.</p>

<p>Charles Dibdin has a song entitled, <i>The Origin of the Patten</i>.
Fair Patty went out in the mud and the mire, and her thin shoes speedily
were wet. Then she became hoarse and could not sing, while her lover longed
for the sweet sound of her voice.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;My anvil glow'd, my hammer rang,<br>
Till I had form'd from out the fire<br>
To bear her feet above the mire,<br>
 A platform for my blue-eyed Patty.<br>
Again was heard each tuneful close,<br>
My fair one in the patten rose,<br>
&nbsp; Which takes its name from blue-eyed Patty.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>This fanciful derivation of the word was not an original thought of
Dibdin. Gay wrote in his Trivia, 1715:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The patten now supports each frugal dame<br>
That from the blue-eyed Patty takes the name.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>In reality, patten is derived from the French word <i>patin</i>, which
has a varied meaning of the sole of a shoe or a skate.</p>

<p>Pattens were noisy, awkward wear. A writer of the day of their
universality wrote, &quot;Those ugly, noisy, ferruginous, ancle-twisting,
foot-cutting, clinking things called women's pattens.&quot; Notices were
set in church porches enjoining the removal of women's pattens, which, of
course, should never have been worn into church during service-time.</p>

<p>It may have disappeared today, but four years ago, on the door of
Walpole St. Peters, near Wisbeck, England, hung a board which read,
&quot;People who enter this church are requested to take off their
pattens.&quot; A friend in Northamptonshire, England, writes me that
pattens are still seen on muddy days in remote English villages in that
shire.</p>

<p>Men wore pattens in early days. And men did and do wear clogs in English
mill-towns.</p>

<p>There were also horse pattens or horse clogs which horses wore through
deep, muddy roads; I have an interesting photograph of a pair found in
Northampton.</p>

<h3>BATTS AND BROAGS, BOOTS AND SHOES</h3>
<p style='text-indent: 0em'> <img src="images\initialo.png" align=left
alt="O">ne of the first sumptuary laws in New England declared that men of
mean estate should not walk abroad in immoderate great boots. It was a
natural prohibition where all extravagance in dress was reprehended and
restrained. The &quot;great boots&quot; which had been so vast in the reign
of James I seemed to be spreading still wider in the reign of Charles. I
have an old &quot;Discourse&quot; on leather dated 1629, which states fully
the condition of things. Its various headings read, &quot;The general Use
of Leather;&quot; &quot;The general Abuse thereof;&quot; &quot;The good
which may arise from the Reformation;&quot; &quot;The several Statutes made
in that behalf by our ancient Kings;&quot; and lastly a &quot;Petition to
the High Court of Parliament.&quot; It is all most informing; for instance,
in the trades that might want work were it not for leather are named not
only &quot;shoemakers, cordwainers, curriers, etc.,&quot; but many now
obsolete. The list reads:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Book binders.<br>
Budget makers.<br>
Saddlers.<br>
Trunk makers.<br>
Upholsterers.<br>
Belt makers.<br>
Case makers.<br>
Box makers.<br>
Wool-card makers.<br>
Cabinet makers.<br>
Shuttle makers.<br>
Bottle and Jack makers.<br>
Hawks-hood makers.<br>
Gridlers.<br>
Scabbard-makers.<br>
Glovers.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Unwillingly the author added &quot;those <i>upstart trades</i>--Coach
Makers, and Harness Makers for Coach Horses.&quot; It was really feared, by
this sensible gentleman-writer--and many others--that if many carriages and
coaches were used, shoemakers would suffer because so few shoes would be
worn out.</p>

<p>From the statutes which are rehearsed we learn that the footwear of the
day was &quot;boots, shoes, buskins, startups, slippers, or
pantofles.&quot; Stubbes said:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;They have korked shooes puisnets pantoffles, some of
black velvet, some of white some of green, some of yellow, some of Spanish
leather, some of English leather stitched with Silke and embroidered with
Gold &amp; Silver all over the foot.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>A very interesting book has been published by the British Cordwainers'
Guild, giving a succession of fine illustrations of the footwear of
different times and nations. Among them are some handsome English slippers,
shoes, jack-boots, etc. We have also in our museums, historical
collections, and private families many fine examples; but the difficulty is
in the assigning of correct dates. Family tradition is absolutely wide of
the truth--its fabulous dates are often a century away from the proper
year.</p>

<p>Buskins to the knee were worn even by royalty; Queen Elizabeth's still
exist. Buskins were in wear when the colonies were settled. Richard Sawyer,
of Windsor, Connecticut, had cloth buskins in 1648; and a hundred years
later runaway servants wore them. One redemptioner is described as running
off in &quot;sliders and buskins.&quot; American buskins were a
foot-covering consisting of a strong leather sole with cloth uppers and
leggins to the knees, which were fastened with lacings. Startups were
similar, but heavier. In Thynne's <i>Debate between Pride and
Lowliness</i>, the dress of a countryman is described. It runs thus:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;A payre of startups had he on his feete<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lased were up to the small of the legge.<br>
&nbsp;Homelie they are, and easier than meete;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in their soles full many a wooden pegge.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Thomas Johnson of Wethersfield, Connecticut, died in 1840. He owned
&quot;1 Perre of Startups.&quot;</p>

<p>Slippers were worn even in the fifteenth century. In the <i>Paston
Letters</i>, in a letter dated February 23, 1479, is this sentence,
&quot;In the whych lettre was VIII d with the whych I shulde bye a peyr of
slyppers.&quot; Even for those days eightpence must have been a small price
for slippers. In 1686, Judge Samuel Sewall wrote to a member of the Hall
family thanking him for &quot;The Kind Loving Token--the East Indian
Slippers for my wife.&quot; Other colonial letters refer to Oriental
slippers; and I am sure that Turkish slippers are worn by Lady Temple in
her childish portrait, painted in company with her brother. Slip-shoes were
evidently slippers--the word is used by Sewall; and slap-shoes are named by
Randle Holme. Pantofles were also slippers, being apparently rather
handsomer footwear than ordinary slippers or slip-shoes. They are in
general specified as embroidered. Evelyn tells of the fine pantofles of the
Pope embroidered with jewels on the instep.</p>

<p>So great was the use and abuse of leather that a petition was made to
Parliament in 1629 to attempt to restrict the making of great boots. One
sentence runs:--</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The wearing of Boots is not the Abuse; but the generality
of wearing and the manner of cutting Boots out with huge slovenly
unmannerly immoderate tops. What over lavish spending is there in Boots and
Shoes. To either of which is now added a French proud Superfluity of
Leather.<br> <br> &quot;For the general Walking in Boots it is a Pride
taken up by the Courtier and is descended to the Clown. The Merchant and
Mechanic walk in Boots. Many of our Clergy either in neat Boots or Shoes
and Galloshoes. University Scholars maintain the Fashion likewise. Some
Citizens out of a Scorn not to be Gentile go every day booted. Attorneys,
Lawyers, Clerks, Serving Men, All Sorts of Men delight in this Wasteful
Wantonness.<br> <br> &quot;Wasteful I may well call it. One pair of boots
eats up the leather of six reasonable pair of men's
shoes.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Monstrous boots seem to have been the one frivolity in dress which the
Puritans could not give up. In the reign of Charles I boots were superb.
The tops were flaring, lined within with lace or embroidered or fringed;
thus when turned down they were richly ornamental. Fringes of leather,
silk, or cloth edged some boot-tops on the outside; the leather itself was
carved and gilded. The soldiers and officers of Cromwell's army sometimes
gave up laces and fringes, but not the boot-tops. The Earl of Essex, his
general, had cloth fringes on his boots. (See his portrait facing <a
href="#ROBERT_DEVEREUX">here</a>; also the portrait of Lord Fairfax <a
href="#The_right_Honourable_Ferdinand--Lord_Fairfax.">here</a>.) In the
court of Charles II and Louis XIV of France the boot-tops spread to absurd
inconvenience. The toes of these boots were very square, as were the toes
of men's and women's shoes. Children's shoes were of similar form. The
singular shoes worn by John Quincy and Robert Gibbes are precisely
right-angled. It was a sneer at the Puritans that they wore pointed toes.
The shoe-ties, roses, and buckles varied; but the square toes lingered,
though they were singularly inelegant. On the feet of George I (see
portrait <a href="#George_I.">here</a>) the square-toed shoes are ugly
indeed.</p>

<p>James I scornfully repelled shoe-roses when brought to him for his wear;
asking if they wished to &quot;make a ruffle-footed dove&quot; of him. But
soon he wore the largest rosettes in court. Peacham tells that some cost as
much as &pound;30 a pair, being then, of course, of rare lace.</p>

<p><i>Friar Bacon's Brazen Head Prophecie</i>, set into a &quot;Plaie&quot;
or Rhyme, has these verses (1604):</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Then Handkerchers were wrought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Names and true Love Knots;<br>
&nbsp;And not a wench was taught<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A false Stitch in her spots;<br>
&nbsp;When Roses in the Gardaines grew<br>
&nbsp;And not in Ribons on a Shoe.<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>Now</i> Sempsters few are taught<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true Stitch in their Spots;<br>
&nbsp;And Names are sildome wrought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the true love knots;<br>
&nbsp;And Ribon Roses takes such Place<br>
&nbsp;That Garden Roses want their Grace.&quot;<br></blockquote>

<p>Shoes of buff leather, slashed, were the very height of the fashion in
the first years of the seventeenth century. They can be seen on the feet of
Will Sommers in his portrait. Through the slashes showed bright the scarlet
or green stockings of cloth or yarn. Bright-colored shoe-strings gave
additional gaudiness. Green shoe-strings, spangled, gilded shoe-strings,
shoes of &quot;dry-neat-leather tied with red ribbons,&quot; &quot;russet
boots,&quot; &quot;white silken shoe strings,&quot;--all were worn.</p>

<p>Red heels appear about 1710. In Hogarth's original paintings they are
seen. Women wore them extensively in America.</p>

<p>The jack-boots of Stuart days seem absolutely imperishable. They are of
black, jacked leather like the leather bottles and black-jacks from which
Englishmen drank their ale. So closely are they alike that I do not wonder
a French traveller wrote home that Englishmen drank from their boots. These
jack-boots were as solid and unpliable as iron, square-toed and clumsy of
shape. A pair in perfect preservation which belonged to Lord Fairfax in
Virginia is portrayed <a
href="#Jack-boots._Owned_by_Lord_Fairfax_of_Virginia.">here</a>. Had all
colonial gentlemen worn jack-boots, the bootmakers and shoemakers would
have been ruined, for a pair would last a lifetime.</p>

<p>New England dandies wore, as did Monsieur A-la-mode:--</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A pair of smart pumps made up of grain'd leather,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thin he can't venture to tread on a feather.&quot;<br>

<p>Buckles were made of pinchbeck, an alloy of four parts of copper and one
part of zinc, invented by Christopher Pinchbeck, a London watchmaker of the
eighteenth century. Buckles were also &quot;plaited&quot; and double
&quot;plaited&quot; with gold and silver (which was the general spelling of
plated). Plated buckles were cast in pinchbeck, with a pattern on the
surface. A silver coating was laid over this. These buckles were set with
marcasite, garnet, and paste jewels; sometimes they were of gold with real
diamonds. But much imitation jewellery was worn by all people even of great
wealth. Perhaps imitation is an incorrect word. The old paste jewels made
no assertion of being diamonds. Steel cut in facets and combined with gold,
made beautiful buckles. A number of rich shoe and garter buckles, owned in
Salem, are shown <a href="#Shoe_and_Knee_Buckles.">here</a>.</p>

<p>These old buckles were handsome, costly, dignified; they were becoming;
they were elegant. Nevertheless, the fashionable world tired of its
expensive and appropriate buckles; they suddenly were deemed inconveniently
large, and plain shoe-strings took their place. This caused great commotion
and ruin among the buckle-makers, who, with the fatuity of other
tradespeople--the wig-makers, the hair-powder makers--in like calamitous
changes of fashion, petitioned the Prince of Wales, in 1791, to do
something to revive their vanishing trade. But it was like placing King
Canute against the advancing waves of the sea.</p>

<p>When the Revolutionists in France set about altering and simplifying
costume, they did away with shoe-buckles, and fastened their shoes with
plain strings. Minister Roland, one day in 1793, was about to present
himself to Louis XVI while he was wearing shoes with strings. The old
Master of Ceremonies, scandalized at having to introduce a person in such a
state of undress, looked despairingly at Dumouriez, who was present.
Dumouriez replied with an equally hopeless gesture, and the words,
&quot;H&eacute;las! oui, monsieur, tout est perdu.&quot;</p>

<p>President Jefferson, with his hateful French notions, made himself
especially obnoxious to conservative American folk by giving up
shoe-buckles. I read in the <i>New York Evening Post</i> that when he
received the noisy bawling band of admirers who brought into the White
House the Mammoth Cheese (one of the most vulgar exhibitions ever seen in
this country), he was &quot;dressed in his suit of customary black, with
shoes that laced tight round the ankle and closed with a neat leathern
string.&quot;</p>

<p>When shoe-strings were established and trousers were becoming popular,
there seemed to be a time of indecision as to the dress of the legs below
the short pantaloons and above the stringed shoes. That point of
indefiniteness was filled promptly with top-boots. First, black tops
appeared; then came tops of fancy leather, of which yellow was the
favorite. Gilt tassels swung pleasingly from the colored tops. Silken
tassels--home made--were worn. I have a letter from a young American
macaroni to his sweetheart in which he thanks her for her
&quot;heart-filling boot-tossels&quot;--which seems to me a very cleverly
flattering adjective. He adds: &quot;Did those rosy fingers twist the
silken strands, and knot them with thought of the wearer? I wish you was
loveing enough to tye some threads of your golden hair into the tossells,
but I swear I cannot find never a one.&quot; The conjunction of two
negatives in this manner was common usage a hundred years ago; while
&quot;you was&quot; may be found in the writings of our greatest authors of
that date.</p>

<p>In one attribute, women's footwear never varied in the two centuries of
this book's recording. It was always thin-soled and of light material;
never adequate for much &quot;walking abroad&quot; or for any wet weather.
In fact, women have never worn heavy walking-boots until our own day.
Whether high-heeled or no-heeled they were always thin.</p>

<p>The curious &quot;needle-pointed&quot; slippers which are pictured <a
href="#Wedding_Slippers_and_Brocade._1712.">here</a> were the bridal
slippers at the wedding of Cornelia de Peyster, who married Oliver Teller
in 1712. Several articles of her dress still exist; and the background of
the slippers is a breadth of the superb yellow and silver brocade wedding
gown worn at the same time.</p>

<p>When we have the tiny pages of the few newspapers to turn to, we learn a
little of women's shoes. There were advertisements in 1740 of
&quot;mourning shoes,&quot; &quot;fine silk shoes,&quot; &quot;flowered
russet shoes,&quot; &quot;white callimanco shoes,&quot; &quot;black shammy
shoes,&quot; &quot;girls' flowered russet shoes,&quot; &quot;shoes of black
velvet, white damask, red morocco, and red everlasting.&quot; &quot;Damask
worsted shoes in red, blue, green, pink color and white,&quot; in 1751.
There were satinet patterns for ladies' shoes embroidered with flowers in
the vamp. The heels were &quot;high, cross-cut, common, court, and
wurtemburgh.&quot; Some shoes were white with russet bands. &quot;French
fall&quot; shoes were worn both by women and men for many years.</p>

<p><a href="#Wedding_Slippers.">Here</a> is a pair of beautiful brocade
wedding shoes. The heels are not high. Another pair was made of the silken
stuff of the beautiful sacque worn by Mrs. Carroll. These have high heels
running down to a very small heel-base. In the works of Hogarth we may find
many examples of women's shoes. In all the old shoes I have seen, made
about the time of the American Revolution, the maker's name is within and
this legend, &quot;Rips mended free.&quot; Many heels were much higher and
smaller than any given in this book.</p>

<p>It is astonishing to read the advocacy and eulogy given by sensible
gentlemen to these extreme heels. Watson, the writer of the <i>Annals of
Philadelphia</i>, extolled their virtues--that they threw the weight of the
wearer on the ball of the foot and spread it out for a good support. He
deplores the flat feet of 1830.</p>

<p>In 1790 heels disappeared; sandal-shapes were the mode. The quarters
were made low, and instead of a buckle was a tiny bow or a pleated ribbon
edging. In 1791 &quot;the exact size&quot; of the shoe of the Duchess of
York was published--a fashionable fad which our modern sensation hunters
have not bethought themselves of. It was 5 3/4 inches in length; the
breadth of sole, 1 3/4 inches. It was a colored print, and shows that the
lady's shoe was of green silk spotted with gold stars, and bound with
scarlet silk. The sole is thicker at the back, forming a slight uplift
which was not strictly a heel. Of course, this was a tiny foot, but we do
not know the height of the duchess.</p>

<p>I have seen the remains of a charming pair of court shoes worn in France
by a pretty Boston girl. These had been embroidered with paste jewels,
&quot;diamonds&quot;; while to my surprise the back seam of both shoes was
outlined with paste emeralds. I find that this was the mode of the court of
Marie Antoinette. The queen and her ladies wore these in real jewels, and
in affectation wore no jewels elsewhere.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Gaskell's <i>My Lady Ludlow</i> we are told that my lady would
not sanction the mode of the beginning of the century which &quot;made all
the fine ladies take to making shoes.&quot; Mrs. Blundell, in one of her
novels, sets her heroine (about 1805) at shoe-making. The shoes of that day
were very thin of material, very simple of shape, were heelless, and in
many cases closely approached a sandal. A pair worn by my great-aunt at
that date is shown on this page. American women certainly had tiny feet.
This aunt was above the average height, but her shoes are no larger than
the number known to-day as &quot;Ones&quot;--a size about large enough for
a girl ten years old.</p>

<br><br>

<p>It was not long after English girls were making shoes that Yankee girls
were shaping and binding them in New England. I have seen several old
letters which gave rules for shaping and directions for sewing party-shoes
of thin light kid and silk. It is not probable that any heavy materials
were ever made up by women at home. Sandals also were worn, and made by
girls for their own wear from bits of morocco and kid.</p>

<p>In the early years of the century the thin, silk hose and low slippers
of the French fashions proved almost unendurable in our northern winters.
One wearer of the time writes, &quot;Many a time have I walked Broadway
when the pavement sent almost a death chill to my heart.&quot; The Indians
then furnished an article of dress which must have been grateful indeed,
pretty moccasins edged with fur, to be worn over the thin slippers.</p>

<p>An old lady recalled with precision that the first boots for women's
wear came in fashion in 1828; they were laced at the side. Garters and
boots both had fringes at the top.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
